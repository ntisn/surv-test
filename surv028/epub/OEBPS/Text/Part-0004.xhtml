        <p>This monograph deals with the theory of linear ordinary differential operators of arbitrary order. Unlike treatments which focus on spectral theory, our treatment centers on the construction of special eigenfunctions (generalized Jost solutions) and on the <em>inverse problem</em>: the problem of reconstructing the operator from (minimal) data associated to the special eigenfunctions. In the second order case this program includes spectral theory and is equivalent to quantum mechanical scattering theory; the essential analysis involves only the bounded eigenfunctions. For higher order operators, although bounded eigenfunctions are again sufficient for spectral theory and quantum scattering theory, they are far from sufficient for a successful inverse theory.</p>
        <p>The inverse theory which we develop is motivated by its applications to nonlinear wave equations in the spirit of KdV, although we feel that it is also of intrinsic interest for the theory of ordinary differential equations. Applications to spectral theory and quantum mechanical scattering theory, in addition to nonlinear wave equations, are included.</p>
