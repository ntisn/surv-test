<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>With over 60 figures, tables, and
diagrams, the text is both an intuitive introduction to and
rigorous study of finite symmetric inverse semigroups. It turns
out that these semigroups enjoy many of the classical features of
the finite symmetric groups. For example, cycle notation,
conjugacy, cummutativity, parity of permutations, alternating
subgroups, Klein 4-group, Ruffini&#x00027;s result
on cyclic groups, Moore&#x00027;s presentations of the symmetric and
alternating groups, and the centralizer theory of symmetric groups
are extended to more general counterparts in the semigroups
studied here. We also classify normal subsemigroups, study
congruences, and illustrate and apply an Eilenberg-style wreath
product. The basic semigroup theory is further extended to partial
transformation semigroups, and the Reconstruction
Conjecture of graph theory is recast as a Rees ideal-extension conjecture.</p>
