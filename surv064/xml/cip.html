<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Stochastic Partial Differential
Equations is an interdisciplinary area on the crossroads of
stochastic processes (random fields) and partial differential
equations. This volume presents the topic of SPDE&#x00027;s from different
perspectives, as seen by six groups of researchers working in the
most active and promising areas of the field. The goal of this book
is to indicate what the main topics of interest are in this
fascinating field, and where breakthroughs are being made today.</p>

<p>This book will be of interest to graduate students and researchers in various areas of Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, Economics, etc.</p>
