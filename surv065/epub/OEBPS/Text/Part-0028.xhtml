            <p>It seems appropriate for me to acknowledge here a number of benefactors and friends. It is germane to this work that I began my graduate studies in midcentury at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, spring 1951, and continued as a Teaching Assistant at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, 1951–1955. Previously I had been a radio technician (“RT”) in the U.S. Navy (1945–1946) before attending UK as an undergraduate on the GI bill (1946–1950).</p>

              <p>Incredibly, despite the extensive mathematics required in the Navy’s RT program (which lasted an entire year), at UK I was still required to take College Algebra (and from an insipid text). Fortunately Dr. Theodore (“Ted”) Adkins enlivened the course with a historical development, tracing algebra back to the Arabs (see van der Waerden <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid8-ref-20" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid8">85</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>, <em>History of Algebra</em>, about this.)⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2583-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2583"><sup>1</sup></a> His enormous enthusiasm for the subject, usually thought of merely as a tool of science and higher mathematics, and his countless anecdotes, made an indelible impression on me, and no doubt influenced me to continue the study of algebra.</p>
              <p>I also salute Professor James (“Jim”) Ward for introducing me to abstract algebra at UK, first using the book by Marie Weiss, and then the Birkhoff and Mac Lane classic “<em>A Survey of Modern Algebra</em>.” These were considered revolutionary if not incendiary books back then! (my sophomore year at UK). (I am grateful to UK’s Professor Wimberly Royster for refreshing my memory in a letter in October 1997.)</p>
              <p>In addition, I have Professor A. W. Goodman to thank for, e.g. Gauss’ quadratic reciprocity law <em>inter alia</em>, using Uspensky’s book. I later found out why Professor Goodman eschewed using his first name. He was a member of the Institute in 1955-1956, and I found his first name there, Adolph. (<em>Circa</em> post WWII, this was not a popular name, his colleagues called him “Al.”)</p>
              <p>Professor D. E. South at UK taught me statistics and probability with such delightful gusto that I switched my major to actuarial mathematics under his spell. I still remember the Euler-Maclaurin sum formula, but I switched back to pure mathematics <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline">(<svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠨⠅" aria-label="equals" style="vertical-align: 0.257ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.503ex" height="0.568ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -395 720 272" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-3D"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$=$</span></span> mathematics that has yet to be applied?) at Purdue.</p>
              <p>Professor Arthur Rosenthal (a former Dean at Heidelberg U.) made the wellordering of the cardinal numbers in a course in Set Theory at Purdue in spring 1952 a spellbinding spectacle that lives in my mind’s eye these many years after.</p>
              <p>When Professor Rosenthal used up the front blackboards, he asked the class rhetorically “Und [sic] now class, vere do ve go from here?’ A wag convulsed the class by saying “To the next blackboard!” The professor raised his eyebrows and exclaimed “Ach, so!” and continued the scale of ordinal numbers on the side board.</p>
              <p>And <em>bless</em> Professor Sidney H. Gould for persuading me to “take the plunge” into Set Theory, the <em>sine qua non</em> of much of modern mathematics. Among other things from Set Theory and the controversies it stirred up I found out that mathematics was not the isle of tranquility that previously I had been taught. (See for example Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen in the ensuing.)</p>

              <p>How often have I said “I owe everything to Mama.” She has a name: Vila Belle Foster; she encouraged my intellectual development during The Great Depression (1929–1939) when neighbor’s children were being asked to work. (“To help make ends meet” is the cliché but to put food on the table was the real reason.) She often said to me, “<em>Carl, get as much education as you can, because it’s something that can never be taken away from you</em>” (This insecurity was a legacy of the depression, in which banks closed and people were thrown out of work.) My late sister, Louise, volunteered to help make ends meet, and, although a straight A student unfortunately did not finish high school. Sis was devoted to family happiness and bought Mama the appliances which eased her life of ceaseless labor. She also made the most mouth-watering chocolate and lemon meringue pies—I’m sure Sis landed in ‘pie heaven’ after her death in 1984, exactly 20 years after Mama’s. Wherever it is, I want to go there when I die. (Not long after this was written, I prophetically discovered in “Moe’s Books” in Berkeley a delightful book by John D. Barrow with the punning title “A Pi in the Sky”.)⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2585-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2585"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

              <p>Mathematically I owe “everything” to Professor Sam Perlis, who infected me with his love for Galois theory in a memorable course he taught to uncomprehending students. If ever pearls were cast before blind eyes, these beautiful theorems were.</p>
              <p>Sam’s appeal was so lofty-intellectual that I often wondered if he knew how <strong>little</strong> at times we students comprehended. At the same time, he inspired me to <em>really</em> understand this beautiful theory, and in doing so, I was weaned away from the reliance on the rote learning that practically everybody practiced.

              <p>With Sam’s guidance in 1954–55, I wrote my Ph.D. thesis on Galois theory “Normal bases and completely basic fields” in 1954–55 which was published in the <em>Transactions of the American Mathematical Society</em>, two years later in 1957. (Thirty years later, in 1986, my theorems were rediscovered and published by <em>two</em> mathematicians (Blessenohl and Johnsen) in the <em>Journal of Algebra</em>, and five years later in yet another paper in <em>Archiv der Mathematik</em> in which I was duly acknowledged.

              <p>Originally a stage actress, Ulla Jacobsson attracted world-wide attention by swimming nude in a Swedish lake in her second film “One Summer of Happiness” (1951). Sometime in 1952 Sam and I saw this film in an “Art Theatre” in West Lafayette, Indiana, where Purdue is located. “One Summer of Happiness” was a love story, and we fell in love with Ulla, along with millions of others! The sad, tragic ending in the film, in a senseless moped accident, intensified our feelings. She was the only movie star whose autograph I solicited. Was I ever surprised when she sent me an autographed photograph—but, alas, completely clad!</p>
              <p>The first thing I did, when I visited Sweden for the International Congress of Mathematicians in the summer 1962, was swim in a Swedish lake near Linköping at the home of Jan Edvard Odhnoff, whom I met at the Institute for Advanced Study in the Fall of 1961.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2589-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2589"><sup>3</sup></a> As you might guess, the frigid water doused my ardor—for Swedish lakes—but not for Ulla, who died in 1982.</p>

              <p>Without “little Fred” (6’4” tall), I never would have known the meaning of the word “brother” He was loyal (I started to write “faithful”), generous, and fun. At my retirement party at Rutgers on April 30th of this year, he regaled the department with how I taught him to drive. “Carl was the first member of the family to have a car” (a Jeep loaner from Collier Encyclopedia where I had a summer job)—“He tossed me the keys, and said, “remember two things: (1) Don’t run into anything; and (2) Don’t run over anybody! When I returned in an hour, I had learned to drive!” The Department gave him an ovation.</p>
              <p>At this juncture somebody said, “That’s the way he teaches <em>calculus</em>”, then somebody else said, “He doesn’t teach calculus, the students say he teaches Art, Philosophy, Literature, Love of Life, and <em>everything except calculus</em> “</p>
              <p>I never before realized how much fun it is to be roasted, or to retire.</p>

              <p>According to Karen H. Parshall, my math lineage descends from Hubert Newton (without Ph.D.) at Yale, E.H. Moore (about whom she wrote in her article <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid38-ref-24" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid38">84</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>), L.E. Dickson, A.A. Albert, and S. Perlis (all four at Chicago). As an amazing coincidence, three of the five served as President of the American Mathematical Society: E.H. Moore (1901–1903); L.E. Dickson (1917–1919) and A.A. Albert (1965–1967). Who ever has had so much to live up to? According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2594-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2594"><sup>5</sup></a>, Newton had just 2 students but 4261 descendants, Moore had 21 and 4259, Dickson 53 and 473, Albert 29 and 152, Perlis 3 and 23, while I had 8 and 20 respectively. (I have my son Dr. Japheth Wood to thank for this stat.)</p>
              <p>My father was Herbert Spencer Faith who, as did my mother, grew up on a farm outside Paducah, Kentucky. While he never finished high school, he was an omnivorous reader who captivated you with his blue-green eyes and his serene, mildly abstracted disposition. Women adored him and I idolized him. (I had a lot to live up to in this too!)</p>

              <p>I also owe a great debt to my late brother Eldridge (“Edgie”)⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2596-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2596"><sup>6</sup></a>, who was the “guiding light” of the family for working his way through Indiana University and becoming a top-notch research chemist for Eli Lilly, Pitman-Moore, Dow and other pharmaceutical companies. He held over 45 patents for sulfa drugs, dating back to pre-World War II, which were the drugs of choice before the discovery of penicillin, and credited with the low death rates for “sulfa dusted” wounded GI’s. Way back in 1945 while I was in high school, Edgie helped me write a paper on the medical uses of radioactive elements. Years later I thought of him when I was given a radioactive “cocktail” to drink for a diagnostic procedure. Edgie died in 1995, age 80.</p>

              <p>On the undergraduate level, these two men shaped my teaching philosophy as much as Sam. Clifton Hazard was in charge of putting teaching in the title Teaching Assistant or TA. His philosophy was the same as Perlis’: <em>learning meant reaching and achieving, not rote regurgitation of letter-perfect lectures all carefully written on the board</em>. His motto was “make the student fire you as soon as you can”, that is, dispense with his need of you. His method was: (1) Force students to read the text, and under no circumstances read it to them; (2) Force them to do the homework, and under no circumstances do it for them. (Hints were allowed, however. <em>In other words give them the keys and tell them to remember the two things I told Fred?</em>)</p>
              <p>After 4 years and 4 summers of teaching by these principles, I became so excited by the progress students made that I never ever abandoned them, even though other universities (I taught at Michigan State, Penn <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline">State<svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠀⠄⠄⠄" aria-label="ellipsis" style="vertical-align: -0.017ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.852ex" height="0.255ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -114 887 122" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-2026"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$\ldots$</span>)</span> did not have the same quality of math students as did Purdue, the largest engineering school in the country. And certainly no one with Hazard’s mathematical and intellectual integrity vis-a-vis undergrads. (Not that others were not supportive. Certainly Orrin Frink, the Chair at Penn State during my two years there, maintained and supported the highest academic standards.)</p>
              <p>Harold Jonah (father of David Jonah—Detroit U) backed me up with his impressive eyebrows and visage that could make your knees shake when he frowned at you. I tried to keep this from ever happening to me! And when I left Purdue, the chairman, Ralph Hull (another of L.E. Dickson’s students!), gave me an unbeatable letter of recommendation. But now I wonder if it was entirely deserved, since he consistently beat me at golf. In any event, I soon lost my “wings” when I found that students elsewhere did not have the preparation and motivation of Purdue’s “Boilermakers” I wish everyone could have the same keen and kindly instruction in their teaching as these three gave me.</p>

            <section id="ltxid2598" data-ams-doc="section" data-ams-doc-level="1"><h2><span data-ams-doc="title">John Dyer-Bennett and Gordon Walker</span></h2>
              
              <p>In my third year at Purdue I signed up for a reading course in A. A. Albert’s “Structure of algebras,” expecting Sam, who was Albert’s student, and who helped him write the book, to guide me through it. Much to my surprise, Sam persuaded John Dyer-Bennet (Professor Emeritus, Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota) to take his place. This was an enormous piece of serendipity, because I learned what a talented professor John was, which I otherwise would not have known. He took apart the book line by line, and then rewrote it correctly, that is, according to his tastes, which were impeccable. This eliminated a great deal of obscurity in Albert’s exposition, and contributed to a deeper understanding of linear associative algebras than I would have acquired otherwise.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I never before expressed my gratitude to John for doing this for me, but now, forty-three years later, I do so. Thanks, John.</p>
              <p>In an entirely different way, Gordon L. Walker (the late Executive Director of the A.M.S.) guided me through a course in Algebraic Geometry. This being visual, was decidedly more intuitive, and we did not rewrite the text: R. J. Walker’s “Algebraic Curves.” (R. J. was no relation to Gordon.)</p>
              <p>Gordon collaborated with Sam smack dab in midcentury to prove a beautiful and seminal theorem stating that for two finite Abelian groups the rational group algebras determine the groups (see 11.11). This result does not generalize to other fields or groups (see <strong>sup</strong> 11.11 and 11.11ff).</p>

              <p>I recall back at Purdue when Mel stormed into our lives how nonplused I was that he and I were almost the same age, and he already had his Ph.D. (I got detained by the US Navy back in 1945.) Mel brought so much energy into the department in seminars and colloquia—you could always count on him to enliven what heretofore had been rather subdued (actually boring!) mathematical interactions. He was a dynamo of ideas—conjectures—theorems and of course, hand-waving proofs! I’m surprised Mel lived this long, I think others are too, because we were sure that long before this he would wear out from exhaustion! We owed so much to him, Gillman &amp; Jerison for the seminars on the delightful, fruitful subject of “Rings of Continuous Functions.” The book by Gillman and Jerison, reflected the work of all three of them. (My copy is annotated. The Institute for Advanced Study, Sept. 25, 1960 or about 3 weeks after I arrived there. The book was published in 1960 by Van Nostrand in Princeton.) You might say that Mel was an honorary or silent co-author, and they did write a paper “On a Theorem of Gelfand and Kolmogoroff concerning maximal ideals in rings of continuous functions,” (1954) which they had discovered independently, I think.</p>
              <p>His paper with Jerison and Johnson (1962, see References) on lattice ordered rings was a sequel to Don Johnson’s Ph.D. thesis (1960, see References).</p>
              <p>Another ground-breaking paper, co-authored with Jerison, was “The space of minimal primes of a commutative ring.” (1965). His “On a class of rings that are elementary divisor rings” (1973) is another much cited paper with his great theorem, “Every unit regular ring <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠠⠗" aria-label="upper R" style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.294ex" height="1.372ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -657 620 657" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D445"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$R$</span></span> is an elementary divisor ring, in fact, every <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠍⠈⠡⠝" aria-label="m times n" data-owns="0 1 2" style="vertical-align: -0.054ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="5.343ex" height="1.184ex" role="tree" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -541 2559.4 567" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g role="presentation" stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g role="presentation" data-owns-id="3"><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-braillelabel="⠍" aria-label="m" aria-setsize="3" aria-posinset="1" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="0"><use role="presentation" xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D45A"/></g><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-braillelabel="⠈⠡" aria-label="times" aria-setsize="3" aria-posinset="2" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="1" transform="translate(1052.2,0)"><use role="presentation" xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-D7"/></g><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-braillelabel="⠝" aria-label="n" aria-setsize="3" aria-posinset="3" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="2" transform="translate(1994.4,0)"><use role="presentation" xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D45B"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$m\times n$</span></span> matrix ring over <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠠⠗" aria-label="upper R" style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.294ex" height="1.372ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -657 620 657" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D445"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$R$</span></span> is equivalent to a diagonal matrix, and every <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠝⠈⠡⠝" aria-label="n times n" data-owns="0 1 2" style="vertical-align: -0.054ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.79ex" height="1.184ex" role="tree" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -541 2294.4 567" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g role="presentation" stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g role="presentation" data-owns-id="3"><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-braillelabel="⠝" aria-label="n" aria-setsize="3" aria-posinset="1" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="0"><use role="presentation" xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D45B"/></g><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-braillelabel="⠈⠡" aria-label="times" aria-setsize="3" aria-posinset="2" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="1" transform="translate(787.2,0)"><use role="presentation" xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-D7"/></g><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-braillelabel="⠝" aria-label="n" aria-setsize="3" aria-posinset="3" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="2" transform="translate(1729.4,0)"><use role="presentation" xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D45B"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$n\times n$</span></span> matrix of <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠠⠗" aria-label="upper R" style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.294ex" height="1.372ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -657 620 657" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D445"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$R$</span></span> is unit regular.

              <p>I think it’s high-time for Mel to sit down and write (after Paul Halmos) his “Automathography”! He has interacted with hundreds and hundreds of mathematicians in an essential positive way—a kind of beacon for us lesser mortals one could say.

              <p>These warm people greatly enriched the lives of students and faculty at Purdue. Joop Kemperman arrived from Holland in 1951, and his beautiful bride, Vilna, came a year later. By the vagaries of academic life, Joop is now a Rutgers Professor Emeritus, after spending 25 years at the University of Rochester. He retired in 1995 shortly after Vilna died.</p>
              <p>Len Gillman (U. of Texas, Austin) spent 5 years of his life as a professional pianist before taking up mathematics. (In the Amer. Math. Monthly, 106 (1999) p. 97, it is stated by Kenneth A. Ross in the “Distinguished Service Award for Leonard Gillman” that “Len held a piano fellowship for five years at the Julliard Graduate School before turning to mathematics.”) He frequently gave recitals at national meetings of the American Mathematical Society. He and his wife, Reba, were active West Lafayette music lovers, and Reba sang in Gilbert and Sullivan operas.</p>
              <p>For years, Purdue University was host to the Metropolitan Opera when it still toured the country, making stops in Bloomington and West Lafayette.

              <p>They were fellow workers and friends who toiled in the mathematical vineyard at Purdue, and in fact, Bob Gambill is a professor emeritus there, while Jack Hale is Director of Applied Mathematics at Georgia Tech. Our real work there was basketball (the Intramural League) and golf, a game Paul Mostert taught me. I called Bob “Shotgun” for his propensity for shooting the ball from any spot or position on the court. Jack was Little All-American at Berea College (Kentucky), one of our farm teams! After several close games we lost the Intramural League Trophy to the undergraduate team. But it wasn’t Jack’s fault—he played some great ball—<em>we just ran out of steam</em>. (David Riney and Chuck Yeager⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2604-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2604"><sup>8</sup></a> completed the five.)</p>
              <p>Ted Chihara (Purdue U at Calumet) worked under Professor Rosenthal on orthogonal polynomials. Ellen Correl worked with Nelson Shanks in topology, and is an emeritus professor at the University of Maryland. Paul Mostert introduced to me his trick of moving <em>his</em> putter, while <em>you</em> putted, in order to break your concentration!</p>
              <p>For two years I shared an office in the venerable University Hall (the first Purdue building!) on the 4th (top) floor with Don Johnson, Jack Forbes, Paul Mostert among others, including members of the Philosophy Department. One, a cosmopolitan Russian emigre loved New York City, but worked at Purdue only to earn enough “to live in NYC in style” when he visited.</p>

              <p>I have mixed feelings about MSU in East Lansing. The happy memories of the birth of my two daughters, Heidi in 1955 and Cindy in 1957, sustained an overall difficult two years there. (They were born in Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, and as a result I called them “my little sparrows.”)</p>
              <p>Sam Perlis was so much in love with MSU and the beautiful campus which the Red Cedar River bisected, that he told me that if I didn’t accept their offer, then he wouldn’t write any more letters of recommendation for me.</p>
              <p>This negative input from Sam hit me like a ton of bricks, since heretofore he had been unfailingly supportive. For one thing, instead of the two courses I taught as a TA at Purdue, I was scheduled to teach 4 courses, including a course in <strong>slide rule</strong>! I was getting a stiff dose of reality after grad school.</p>
              <p>Second, after the Kentucky Wildcats in Lexington, and the Purdue Boilermakers in West Lafayette, the rah-rah-rah of sports-dominated universities had paled long ago. After UK I no longer went to any of the games or even listened to them on the radio.</p>
              <p>Third, because of my successful defense of my Ph.D. Thesis, I felt I had earned a better chance at research development than the then poor soil of MSU.</p>

              <p>It turned out that my forebodings about MSU were justified: MSU treated young professionals such as Sterling (Sam) Berberian, Robert Blair, W.E. (“Gene”) Deskins (who came to MSU in 1958) as so much cannon fodder for frosh-soph courses in largely engineering calculus. When I left for Penn State,⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2607-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2607"><sup>9</sup></a> and a two course teaching load, and an increase in salary of 50% (to $6500 per academic year), a large number of others left at the same time, including Sam Berberian (U. of Texas, Austin), Bob Blair, Don Johnson, and Bob and Theresa Oehmke ended up in Iowa City.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2608-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2608"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
              <p>The attrition at MSU was so great that an investigation was made by a select committee and I was asked to fill out a detailed questionnaire as to why I had left. Although I was no longer interested, I filled out the form in the hopes that those who remained (e.g. Marvin Tomber and John G. Hocking) might benefit.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I benefited greatly from my association with the fine mathematicians that I have mentioned, and the seminars that I participated in, including Jacobson’s Colloquium volume <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid41-ref-30" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid41">56</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>, and Cartan-Eilenberg’s Homological Algebra <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid41-ref-31" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid41">56</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>.

Another fact of our relationship: I persuaded him to leave OSU to come to MSU. Why? Was it because <strong>misery loves company</strong>? No, I was very fond of Gene and his wife, Barbara. He was like a big brother to me—Barbara called him “cupcake” for some inexplicable reason, but somehow it fit! I also admire him for his deep mathematical ability and knowledge.

Fritz in particular was quite jocular: “Teaching is a calculus problem—you have to minimize,” he told me, apropos of the heavy teaching load. (I wish I could remember some of L. M.

              <p>Vernon Grove, one of the most lovable people that I have met in academia, told me after a tremendous performance of Offenbach’s <em>Gaieté Parisienne</em>, by the Royal Canadian Ballet Company, that ballet is nothing but a “glorified leg-show”!

              <p>After my lecture at Frankfurt where Baer was Professor, he arranged for me to stay with him and his wife at his home in Falkenstein, a high tor overlooking the city. I was deeply honored by this sign of friendship and esteem. Professor Baer confided to me that his reasons for leaving Urbana was that the pension for his wife would have been reduced to just 10% of his if he died even a day before official retirement. Germany was offering a lot more, and a guarantee for his wife. (He spent two years at the Institute for Advanced study in 1935–37 shortly after leaving Germany.)</p>
              <p>There could be no doubt of the deep love he felt for his wife—he was courtly and romantic, helping her into the car, seating her at the table before he sat down and holding hands, and gazing deeply into her eyes. <em>This open expression of love affected me profoundly, as did the excellence of his mathematics</em>.</p>
              <p>Before I left, he again confided to me: he didn’t like music or art created after the 17th century. I was shocked to my toes by this quixotic aspect of this paragon. I thought of the lovely Impressionists, the bold Expressionists, Cubism, Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, 20th Century Realism, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Matisse all being thrown out the window. Of course that still left, e.g. daVinci, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Bellini, Titian et al, the Greeks, the Romans, the Celts, the Norse, Chinese, Hindu and Moslem art galore.</p>
              <p>I couldn’t bear to think of abandoning all that art, not to mention 18th, 19th and 20th century music! But it did explain his courtly love for his wife—I think that definitely dates back to the 17th century!</p>

              <p>While in Munich for my talk at the University, I had a close encounter with death. As I stood at a crowded intersection on the Hauptstrasse waiting for the green light, a van careened close by. Instinctively I stepped back, but, horrifyingly, the man standing next to me got hit by the van’s rearview mirror, and he fell with a thud on the sidewalk, bleeding profusely from his face. I could see his nose had been severed, and his brains exposed under the welling blood, yet he was still alive—so much so that he kept trying to blow his nose with his handkerchief even though there was nothing there!</p>
              <p>I knew there was little hope for him, and tried to comfort him, holding his head up, and talking to him soothingly.</p>
              <p><em>Beruhigen Sie sich! Die Hilfe kommt sofort</em>! “Stay calm, help is coming” was all I could think of to say. As people hurried by, sidestepping him, I yelled “<em>Rufen um Hilfe</em>”, “Call for help!”</p>

              <p>At Heidelberg, I met H. Seifert, F.K. Schmidt, Albrecht Dold, and, one day, miraculously, Marston Morse of the Institute for Advanced Study, in Heidelberg University for a colloquium talk. (I almost laughed outloud at the incongruity of his highpitched, squeaky voice.) At a party for Morse at Seifert’s house that night, Morse and I were the only two Americans, so naturally we spent much of the evening talking (we were both homesick). Before the evening was up, Morse inquired about my plans for next year, and when I said that I would be returning to Penn State, he suggested that I apply for a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship at the “Institute”, as everybody calls it. I still remember my incredulous response: <em>Me? Apply to the Institute?</em> He then suggested that on the application I refer to his invitation. Fritz Kasch agreed to write a letter of recommendation. The two together helped me get the NSF and membership at the Institute, where Marston and I continued our friendship until his death in 1977 at the age of eighty-five.</p>

              <p>After a delightful evening of violin solos and piano-violin duets, Rheinwein, Moselles, and the soft delicate <em>Eiswein</em> from The Black Forest, Frau Seifert drew me aside (Was I not a representative of the USA?) and said, “<em>Lieber Herr Doktor, Sie müssen in die Vereinigten Staaten gehen, und den Amerikanern sagen ‘Nicht alle Deutschen sind Tiere</em>!’ ” (“You must go back to the USA and tell them that not all Germans are animals!”) <em>I was shocked and deeply embarrassed that anyone would judge an individual by the insanity of his compatriots</em>. Think how the Seiferts and other Internationalists must have suffered to think they were being adjudged as Nazis or Nazi sympathizers.</p>
              <p>One thinks of Goethe’s dictum: “So noble in the individual, so base as a (whole) nation.”⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2621-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2621"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
              <p>To this day I can’t think what answer or reassurance I offered Frau Seifert. I thought that <em>my being there</em> was proof of how I regarded Germany and Germans. With sorrow, forgiveness, and hope for the future, I am happy to say, now, 36 years later, that I feel the same way now as I did then.</p>

              <p>That having been said, I have to record a very upsetting experience in fall 1959 that I had in Heidelberg when I attended the Billy Wilder comedy with the stated title starring Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, and Tony Curtis. Before the film began (or after, I can’t recall) there was a short documentary on Germany’s invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939! Why in the name of sanity would this tragedy be considered a companion piece to a MM hit? But that’s not the worse part: the film depicted Polish Calvarymen with lances attacking the German Panzers (tanks) with the inevitable result—the poor Poles were slaughtered. I was simply devastated by the unexplained and unexplainable laughter of the German audience.</p>
              <p>This happened almost 40 years ago, and I wish I could forget it as an isolated demonstration of German cruelty, but, as the saying goes, <em>if wishes were horses (wings) then beggars would ride (fly)</em>. It made me ill to watch those brave Poles dying, fighting for their country with inadequate weapons, and I will never forgive <em>those</em> Germans for thinking it funny.</p>

              <p>Nevertheless, by looking for and too often finding flaws in the national character of Germans, I often wonder if we have not squandered a reservoir of goodwill that many Germans felt for us and the Allies for relieving them of the evident repressive evils of Nazism. Along with the bad, many of the good suffered or perished under Hitler’s repugnant regime. I became good friends with the VW salesman whom I shall call Willy, who in September ’59 sold me a 1953 VW “Bug” for the then magnificent sum of $600, or about 2400 Deutsche Marks. (The Dollar was King back then!) He told me of his being “captured”, i.e., surrendering to the Allies along the Rhine, and being roughly interrogated by an American who happened to be Jewish. Although Willy was fully cooperative and eager to please, the interrogator, after finding a photograph of his wife and family in Willy’s wallet, tore it up in front of him. When I expressed my deepest sympathy at this bit of cruelty, he replied, “Ja, Herr Professor, but you must remember we Germans tore not merely photographs but their people to pieces!” This admission of collective guilt and the frightful imagery moved me to tears. I invited him to my home in Neuenheim, and subsequently we exchanged family visits throughout the academic year 1959–60.</p>

              <p>Marston was born in Waterville, Maine in 1892. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1917, and one year later, he received a medal (“Croix de Guerre”) with a silver star for serving in the American Expeditionary Services in WWI. Other honors include the Meritorious Service U. S. Army Ordinance Award 1944, National Medal of Science 1964, Chevalley, Legion of Honor 1952 and twenty honorary doctorates, including Paris ’46, Pisa ’48, Vienna ’52, Rennes ’53, Maryland ’55, Notre Dame ’56, and Harvard ’65. He was ajoint winner of the Bocher Prize in 1933, and the next year was the Colloquium Lecturer of the American Mathematical Society on “Calculus of Variations in the Large” Marston was President of the American Mathematical Society in 1941–43. Was there ever a more honored American mathematician?</p>
              <p>I didn’t suppose there could be any mathematician who had not heard of Morse Theory, nor not had an inkling of what Morse Theory is about, yet incredibly, one visitor to the Institute asked Marston what field he worked in. Taken back, Marston blurted out “<strong>Why, my theory!</strong>”⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2626-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2626"><sup>14</sup></a> Another time Marston asked what Bourbaki was writing about. When told “Foundations,” Marston retorted, “Always the foundation, never the Cathedral!”</p>
              <p>When I gave Marston a complimentary copy of my algebra, after some time, he remarked at lunch with me, “Carl, I don’t know what your book is about, but you go to great lengths in it!” To be honest, Morse was not the only professor at the Institute who did not share my enthusiasm for “Categories, Rings, and Modules” (the subtitle). Another professor once ridiculed category theory, again at lunch, as “abstract general nonsense” (a familiar epithet), yet years later gave a lecture at a Rutgers Colloquium that was devoted to characterizing all categorical epimorphisms in the concrete category for which he was famous. (I have a witness of impeccable character⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2627-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2627"><sup>15</sup></a> who was there for the epithet and one can verify the conversion to category theory by reading the now famous paper!)</p>
              <p>These make great stories, even if they were apocryphal, like Thomas Hardy’s reply to the question: What is the secret of your success? “Longevity!” was the retort. (Isn’t longevity itself a success of a kind?)</p>

              <p>In my second year at the Institute, I noticed that Marston never attended the lectures that members and sporadic visitors gave. Out of curiousity I asked him why, and he replied, “Carl, I can get more out of reading a paper in five minutes than I can in an hour’s lecture.”⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2629-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2629"><sup>16</sup></a> This puzzled me because few lecturers passed out their notes, and in any case xerox was not available to the members back then. Furthermore, I was still addicted to my student day’s habit of taking notes verbatim for careful reading later. Then too there were social aspects of listening to others that I was in no position to flout—another way of saying that Marston could!</p>

              <p>Louise and I often found ourselves in protest marches against the Vietnam War and nuclear testing, however, I didn’t join her in picketing the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). I was a veteran of World War II whose job in the Navy as Aviation Electronics Technician Mate (i.e., “RT”) and the fact that I had worked at IDA in the summer of 1964, made me privy to the kind of work that Princeton’s IDA did: breaking the secret codes of USSR and China, <strong>inter alia</strong>. I tried to convince her that IDA had nothing to do with napalm and flechettes, whose use horrified the entire world, but Louise persisted in picketing IDA, then situated on Princeton University land, as a symbol of Government.</p>
              <p>“In that case”, I asked her, “why not picket the Post Office?” And she said, “Carl, I’m a grandmother, mother and a wife. My family needs me, and I cannot afford to spend time in jail.”</p>
              <p>But the picketing and marches did have success: (1) Princeton withdrew its hospitality to IDA (which moved across town to Thanet Road); (2) USA and USSR discontinued nuclear testing above ground.</p>

              <blockquote data-ams-style="null">

              <p>Among his honors were President of the American Mathematical Society (1961–63), the National Academy of Sciences in 1955, and the Steele Prize in 1988. His Presidential speech in Cincinnati in 1961 must have been the shortest in history—about 15 minutes—in which he elaborated on how hard the founders worked to establish and foster the Society, and then just as he got everybody on the edge of their seats straining to hear this wonderful eulogy, he abruptly sat down. Deane may have been “gregarious” as Armand said, but he was a man of few words: <em>he liked to listen but was not one to talk much.

              <p>Kay was incredibly funny and death on humbug—she’d break you up with her witty asides. In undermining pomposity, she upheld the principle of democracy: <em>all people are created equal</em>.</p>

              <p>As a member of Rutgers Research Council (1962–64, 66–67), I was asked to recruit Deane for the Rutgers University Science Advisory Council, comprising a dozen or more top science leaders from New Jersey. Deane was not eager to accept.</p>
              <p>Deane was a dedicated professor of the Institute who came to <em>work</em>, that is, <em>think, every morning at 5 o’clock</em>! (Armand Borel movingly recalls this fact in his warm obituary for Deane in the <em>Notices of the American Mathematical Society</em>, September 1992.)⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2636-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2636"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Deane acceded to my request when I pointed out to him that Kay would not be allowed to matriculate at Rutgers College which was then all men. As a consequence of his enjoining the struggle for women’s rights, Rutgers College became co-educational in 1971, just three years after Deane joined the Council. Subsequently, my daughter Heidi’s diploma reads “Rutgers University.” Even though she was in Douglass (an all women’s) College, she was able to take a sizable share of her credits at Rutgers College seated in the largely men’s classes. She is very proud of this application of the Declaration of Independence “All people are created equal.” And I am very proud that Rutgers freed itself of its ancient bias against women.</p>
              <p>And more than that, we have Deane Montgomery to thank for the decisive role that he, as a Professor of the Institute for Advanced Study, played in freeing women at Rutgers. Another personal consequence of this emancipation: in 1982, my wife-to-be, Molly Sullivan, received her second Bachelor Degree (the first from Texas) from Rutgers.</p>

              <p>I found out from Atle Selberg that his given name is Norse for Atila. Was there ever a worse misnomer? He was the antithesis of the raging, rampaging, ravishing Hun, for Atle was quiet, soft-spoken and reflective. The late Hetty (Hedwig) was a Romanian exile when they met in Sweden at the Mittag-Leffler Institute. We often went to their house for parties whose guests formed an International Who’s Who, perhaps with a Nordic, that is, Scandinavian flavor (Carleson, <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline">Gårding,<svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠀⠄⠄⠄" aria-label="ellipsis" style="vertical-align: -0.017ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.852ex" height="0.255ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -114 887 122" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-2026"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$\ldots$</span>).</span> Atle and I would go for long rambles in the Institute Woods where I discovered he knew the names of every tree! And that’s not all—he was a learned man of almost omniscient bent. For example, he foresaw the backlash against the liberalism of President Lyndon B. Johnson and Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, that enabled Richard Milhaus Nixon to squeak to a victory in 1968 and again in 1972. The SDA and the student uprisings that vented youth’s understandable anger at the Vietnam war added fuel to the flames, and Atle said the same thing had happened in Europe, e.g. the collapse of the Weimar Republic in Germany led to Hitler’s ascendency. (Not that Nixon could be compared to Hitler!)</p>
              <p>Atle was a member of the Institute in 1947–48, became a professor in 1949, and a year later won the Fields Medal at the ICM (1950) at Harvard.</p>
              <p>Hetty was a computer scientist who thoroughly enjoyed her work so much that the Selbergs often stayed put in Princeton despite Atle’s love for the island off the coast of Southern Norway where they had a summer home. She was universally admired for her wit, intelligence, and great warmth.</p>

              <p>Sometime in the spring of 1961 Hass approached me about my plans for the academic year 1961–1962. When I answered “back to Penn State,” he told me that the Institute had a policy of offering an additional year’s membership to young mathematicians on the theory that we try to get too much squeezed into a single year and thereby miss the “idea of the Institute.”</p>

              <p>And so I came to stay on at the Institute for the second year. When I expressed apprehension at losing my job at Penn State, both Hass and Deane reassured me of the worth to me, and the mathematical community: it was the chance of a lifetime—take it!</p>
              <p>When I asked Robert Oppenheimer, the Institute’s director, for his advice he referred to the Institute as an Intellectual Hotel, where members get away from the distractions of the mundane world.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2645-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2645"><sup>21</sup></a> He said, for this reason, for the longest time phones were not permitted in the members’ study.

Gaby was an inspired cook, and Armand entertained us with the sound and lore of the great jazz musicians.

              <p>Gaby also had an artistic side that one of her daughters, Anne, inherited. At the Princeton Art Association’s “Sundays with a Model”, Gaby would join Vic and Barbara Camillo and me in “Life Studies”. After two of mine were selected in a juried show at McCarter, I flirted briefly with the idea of becoming another Picasso. I think it was Freeman Dyson who (at my invitation) came to the opening of the show and, at my house afterwards, talked me out of a career change by citing Hilbert’s advice to a young mathematician: <em>Write a novel, you do not have the imagination to become a mathematician</em>. Years later I wonder: do I? When Vic Camillo wrote a congratulatory letter to the Math Department for my retirement claiming that I “could have been either an artist, writer or mathematician”, I found it amusing, wondering: <em>which did I choose?</em></p>

              <p>One of the most influential and admired professors at the Institute was George F. Kennan, a former ambassador to the USSR. He wrote “American Diplomacy, 1900–1950” (U. Chicago Press, 1951), “Soviet-American Relations, 1917–1920, 1 &amp; 2” (Princeton U. Press, 1965), “Soviet Foreign Policy, 1917–1941, “Russia and the West under Lenin and Stalin” (Little, Brown and Company, 1961), and several volumes of Memoirs including an autobiography.</p>
              <p>When I met him, in 1960 at lunch at the Institute (where else?), I knew him as the author of the famous “Containment Policy” vis-a-vis the USSR, which originally had appeared in the forties in <strong>Foreign Affairs</strong>, a magazine I subscribed to (this was a most famous article by the author who signed himself “X”). The Containment Policy was a brilliant original concept of how to deal with USSR imperialism. The policy eschewed a purely military containment, and espoused the true strength of the United States, namely its democratic ideals, its constitution, its freedom, liberty and justice as our most potent weapons against Soviet totalitarianism.</p>
              <p>To quote Michael Howard in his October 31, 1997 review in the Times Literary Supplement of John Lewis Gaddis’ book “We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History” (Oxford U. Press, 1997):</p>

The latter shattered Hilbert’s conjecture that mathematics axioms were complete, or could be completed, by proving that any logical system that was rich enough to axiomatize arithmetic would inevitably lead to questions that could not be answered, <strong>pro or no</strong>, within the system. Gödel’s trick lay in the numbering of the axioms and the propositions, each with its own <strong>Gödel number</strong>, and then asking a question about the Gödel number of one of the propositions which patently could not be answered inside the systems.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2655-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2655"><sup>24</sup></a> The method is called <strong>Gödel’s Diagonal Method</strong>.</p>

              <p>Alexandr Kurosch gave a lecture in Fuld Hall, in the spring of 1961 I believe, relating to a theorem of Ernst Witt, who was a member at the time. Since some lectures were given at Fine Hall on Princeton University campus, Witt went there instead, and arrived just as Kurosch was leaving the lecture room Fuld 114. Never at a loss for words, I put in my oar and introduced the two mathematical giants and told Witt that Kurosch had spoken <em>inter alia</em> on a theorem of his. Witt smiled and said “I proved that theorem when I was in the USSR”. Kurosch did a doubletake and said, in a friendly way, “Why, I never knew you visited the USSR. When was that?” “When I was in the <em>Wehrmacht</em>;” Kurosch turned on his heel and left without a word. Witt could be very chilling, at times.</p>
              <p>I might add that Witt has been criticized for having been at age 20(?) a member of Hitler Youth, and even for having been a Nazi or Nazi supporter (Witt was born in 1911). My recollection of his response is that practically all German youths joined or were forced to join, not only Hitler Youth, but also either the <em>Wehrmacht</em> or the <em>Luftwaffe</em> (literally air weapon, i.e., air force), as Fritz Kasch had been. Could one be a loyal German without espousing the Nazis? And after WWII there were no Nazis (just neo-Nazis).⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2658-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2658"><sup>25</sup></a><span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-label="Superscript comma" data-owns="0 1" style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="0.535ex" height="0.936ex" role="tree" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -448.6 256.2 448.6" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g role="presentation" stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g role="presentation"><g role="presentation" data-owns-id="2"><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-label="Base " aria-setsize="2" aria-posinset="1" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="0"/><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-label="Exponent comma" aria-setsize="2" aria-posinset="2" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="1" transform="translate(33,363) scale(0.707)"><use role="presentation" xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-2C"/></g></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$^,$</span>⁠</span><a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2659-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2659"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

              <p>I once read somewhere, maybe in John Toland’s “Adolf Hitler,” that Hitler described the Institute as a haven for Negroes and Jews.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2661-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2661"><sup>27</sup></a> As an “Intellectual Hotel”, the Institute is indeed a haven, for intellectuals regardless of race or religion, and it would be sheer nonsense to suppose that the Institute would invite Witt in 1960–1961, if indeed he had been a Nazi.

              <p>The co-author with Seifert of “Lehrbuch der Topologie” was an Englishman, William Threlfall, who fell in love with Germany after WWI, and especially Heidelberg, German mathematics, and, of course, the Seiferts. As WWII progressed, he was ordered to leave Germany by the British Government, or suffer the consequences of being charged with aiding the enemy. You could love Germany and hate the Nazis as Threlfall did.</p>

              <p>When I met Witt at the Institute in Fall ’61 we often spoke German. (Although seemingly like all Germans, he spoke English fluently, I <em>still tended to think in German</em>.) Nevertheless, many members of the Institute did not warm to Witt either because of the War, or because of Witt’s lack of tact. Since I had expressed my openness to Germany and Germans through my Fulbright-Nato Postdoctoral at Heidelberg, and could communicate with him in German, I became his <em>de facto</em> friend. P. J. Cohen, who lived in the same apartment building as Witt, also befriended him, so we three often found ourselves in each others’ company.</p>
              <p>Regarding paranoia over Germany and Germans, one member went so far as to say at tea time before a large group that Germany in 1960 was still the world’s biggest threat to peace. However, I polled the group, and he found himself isolated: everybody else thought that the USSR was (or maybe the USA?).</p>

              <p>Previously this paper had been turned down at <em>Proceedings of the A.M.S</em>. because “the proofs were too short”, but Nathan Jacobson accepted it for the more prestigious <em>Bulletin of the A.M.S.</em>, and wrote me that it was a sad day for mathematics when theorems like these were rejected for having simple proofs.

              <p>The Executive Secretary of the Institute was Caroline Underwood (Carol-’line, can’t you hear me calling’, Carol-’line? is the first line of a lovely song that explicated the Southern pronunciation of her name). A lieutenant in the WAVES, she stayed in the WAVES Active Reserve until her retirement in the 80’s. She was the most helpful person imaginable—no task was too small or large for her. Everybody at the Institute raved about her proficiency and helpfulness, but what meant the most to me—and others I am sure—was her great kindness and radiant sunniness. God Bless You Carol-’line, Carol-’line, Carol-’line.</p>

              <p>They were across-the-street neighbors on Einstein drive in 1960–61, and became dear friends. We occasionally baby-sat for each other, and this brings you closer than math does. Mort (Michigan U., Ann Arbor) was the author of a very short proof of Schoenflies’ Theorem that somewhat upstaged Marston Morse’s proof. (I know that Marston was deeply impressed by this evidence of Mort’s youthful genius.)</p>
              <p>The Brown’s were two scintillating people—a terrific couple. Karen was a sociologist who introduced me to the theories of Emil Durkheim. More than that, they were both articulate, intellectually stimulating people you could count on for interesting conversations.</p>
              <p>If I fell a little in love with them, I wasn’t the only one of the members to do so—they were about the most popular couple there—you found them at almost every party (which were in abundance—at least once a week).</p>
              <p>One subject, my favorite, was taboo with Mort. Once in a circle of friends at tea, Mort challenged me by putting a teaspoon in my empty teacup and said, “There, try to make something sexual out of that!” Everybody roared with laughter, and then Mort reddened as he suddenly realized the Freudian overtones of his action.</p>

On a Thursday, I took Cliff with me to the Princeton YMCA-YWCA pool for a swim. I thought I was hot stuff, and challenged Cliff to a race—my backstroke vs. his crawl—and he beat me by a stroke.

              <p>The late Professor Israel Nathan Herstein (of Chicago U.) preferred to be called Yitz. While at Purdue I met Yitz at the frequent mathematical meetings that took place the University of Chicago. Often Yitz would take us to Mama Luigi’s for a late dinner, where we talked for hours. He had a love for Italian food and Italy—we always managed to end up Italian: Dimaggio’s in San Francisco, Valerio’s in Cincinnati, Otello in Rome, Sardis or Manganaro’s in New York, the “Annex” in Princeton. (Yitz kept an automobile in storage in Rome for his frequent visits there—but he was equally at home in all of the world’s great cities.)</p>
              <p>How Yitz came to help me get the Fulbright-NATO Postdoc at Heidelberg is a long story I can’t go into here, but the records will show that he wrote in favor of my application.</p>
              <p>Like many, many mathematicians, I fell under the spell of his brilliance, and as a matter of fact, I owe him for recommending to me my first Ph.D. student, Barbara Osofsky. When we were in Stockholm for the ICM in summer 1962, he told me that she had been at Cornell but married “Abe”, and was now at Rutgers, where I was headed, having completed membership at the Institute 1960–1962. He urged me to invite her to my seminars, which I did in the fall of 1962.</p>
              <p>I once joked to Yitz, “I know how you get so many NSF contracts.” He bit, so I told him, “Because otherwise you would go to Washington and castrate them!” He laughed and said, “Something like that.” (Lest this be thought of as a sexist joke, this was way before there were any female directors.)</p>

Frink had asked me to help recruit Fritz while I was still in Germany, and Fritz had accepted the offer of full professor at Penn State in Fall ’61 while I was still at the Institute. He brought with him not only Bruno Mueller, but two gifted students Rudi Rentschler and Ulrich Oberst with him. They proved to be intellectually challenging auditors. When I was vague or handwaved a proof, Rudi announced that “the direction we are going is clear but it’s the details on how to get there that are unclear.”⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2675-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2675"><sup>28</sup></a> This was about a course that I gave on “Fields of Algebraic Functions,” based on Chevalley’s book.

              <p>How I recruited Fritz for Penn State makes an interesting story: meat was still scarce and expensive in Germany in 1959–60, but because of my Fulbright I was able to purchase it at the Army PX at American prices. Now Fritz was very fond of steak, and the size of the steaks we fed him in our Pension in <em>Neuenheim</em> made his eyes pop out. I used to joke that Penn State bought Fritz for the price of a steak! To illustrate the belt-tightening of the German people even then, years after the war: when occasionally I did buy a pound of steak at the <em>Fleischerei</em> (Butchers) for my family, the Fleischer would say, “<em>Sie meinen ein Viertel Pfund, nicht wahr?</em> (You mean a fourth of a pound, don’t you?) They weren’t joking: few Germans in Neuenheim could afford an entire pound.</p>

              <p>The Members and Faculty of the Institute are listed in “A Community of Scholars 1930–1980”. According to Pamela Hughes, Institute Development Officer, this is currently being brought up-to-date for the millennium. The 1980 edition with a Foreword by Harry Woolf, the Director, contains the historical development as an idea and a place. (See J. Mitchell <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid63-ref-21" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid63">80</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>.) Oswald Veblen was the first professor and Abraham Flexner the first Director. It appears that Bamberger was thinking of founding another Rockefeller University type institution, but Flexner, who was an M.D. who greatly influenced American medicine, thought differently. He was steeped in the Classics and Philosophy and he thought that America needed a place where the world’s greatest thinkers gathered to converse free of the distractions of classes, lectures, and students. Bamberger agreed and to this day the professors there do not offer courses, although they may offer extensive lectures, such as André Weil’s “History of Number Theory” which was widely attended, and later published.</p>

              <p>The democratic principle at the Institute encouraged free exchange of ideas in an informal relaxed setting, notably at lunch, tea or dinner. Often I had lunch with three physicists, Freeman Dyson, Chen Ning Yang, Abraham Pais, and others (often Tsung Dao Lee) in the dining room on top of Fuld Hall. The topics careened from Dyson’s idea of perpetual motion utilizing twin stars to back to earth crushing of the human rights movement in China, or any improbable thing. I am reminded of how in Alice in Wonderland, the Red Queen thought of “six impossible things before breakfast.” When you lunch with four geniuses, it’s intellectual hardball, and I was completely out of it.</p>
              <p>Lee and Yang shared a Nobel for their devising the experiment which disproved parity in laws of physics. There’s an (apocryphal?) story about a son of Yang when asked at school what he wanted to do when he grew up, he quipped “Win a Nobel all by myself!”</p>

              <p>Helen was Einstein’s assistant, who lived with him and his wife at 112 Mercer Street in Princeton. After his death, in 1955, she moved into an office in Fuld Hall, and catalogued his papers, writing English abstracts since everything was in German. She helped dozens of Einstein scholars, and physicists to access Einstein’s work and letters, and as such, she was herself an Einstein scholar in the deepest sense. I wrote about her accomplishments in letters to the local Princeton papers when in her obituary they referred to her as his secretary. In doing so, I was basing my remarks on 25 years of friendship with Helen, but I wasn’t the best person to say so. Was I ever happy when Abraham Pais backed me up in the strongest terms—he described how invaluable Helen had been in aiding his own research for his award-winning book on Einstein and his work, “<em>Subtle is the Lord</em>.”</p>
              <p>Helen was a living saint—I think the right meaning still holds true: completely and utterly unselfish, without malice, or bitterness, helpful and kind to everybody. She adored children and babysat <em>gratis</em> for members of the Institute.</p>
              <p>She co-authored with Banesh Hoffman a book on the wit and wisdom of Einstein (<em>Albert Einstein, The Human Side</em>, Princeton, 1979). Once Einstein, lecturing in Zurich without a fee, noticed that the superintendent was charging Hörgelt⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2681-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2681"><sup>29</sup></a> (an admission fee) and asked him, why do you charge admission, when I don’t take a fee? The Super replied, “Herr Professor, think about the heat!” Helen told me this story in German, “<em>Denken Sie mal, Herr Professor, an die Heizung!</em>”</p>
              <p>Another story that Helen told me. Einstein’s first paper was rejected by a Swiss Physics Journal as being <em>too</em> short. He thought about it, <em>added one sentence</em>, and <em>then</em> the paper was accepted!</p>

At Dearborn, he would come into the back of the room behind us and flick off the lights and begin 10-second slides of aircraft, enemy and ours, for rapid ID. He had a nasalized voice and his accent was definitely Bostonian (like JFK’s “Hahvahd”) <em>but he himself I never saw</em><span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠀⠄⠄⠄" aria-label="ellipsis" style="vertical-align: -0.017ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.852ex" height="0.255ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -114 887 122" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-2026"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$\ldots$</span></span><em>I only recognized his voice</em>.</p>
              <p>At various times we tried without success to place each other—it was then 6 years after I had been demobilized (demobbed as they call it) from the Navy, and neither guessed the <em>Secret</em> until one day after class I literally bumped into him at the A&amp; P (in West Lafayette) and shouted: <strong>It was at Dearborn!</strong></p>
              <p>What an amazing coincidence! We became the best of friends at Purdue, with Arthur Guy and his wife Dorothy, and visited each other over the years. He was a gourmet who had a nose for wine which he twirled in the glass and warmed with his hands. He also taught us to warm up cheese manually. Unfortunately he inherited a fatal genetic condition, from his family in Worcester, Massachusetts, and died in 1960 in his thirties.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2683-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2683"><sup>30</sup></a> Dorothy, a <em>summa cum laude</em> from Stevens College in Missouri, visited us after his death at the Institute in 1962.

              <p>The reason I finally <em>did</em> recognize her was this: At Purdue she was tall and always jogging (to stay in condition for the swimming team?) and that is how I remembered her. That and her Athenian beauty and wisdom, for she also planned to become a Nobel Laureate, I believe. <em>But even as a sophomore at Purdue she was a Goddess from Southern Illinois</em>.</p>
              <p>And this is how I got invited to <strong>all</strong> of the Fall and spring Dinner Dances at the Institute during their tenure there. Once I asked her, “Don’t you get tired of us?” And she said, “<em>No</em>” and then she added this Kelshian fillip, “<em>You</em> at least show up.”</p>
              <p>So this is how I knew she had made the invitations. That and the fact that they stopped when Harry stepped down.</p>

              <p>Not long after Samuel Beckett’s enigmatic play “Waiting for Godot” was staged (in 1955) I acted out a real-life version at the Penn Central Railroad Station in New Brunswick, waiting for Gottfried Köthe, our Colloquium speaker. As Colloquium Chairman of the department, I had invited Gottfried, who was a visiting professor at the University of Maryland where I had lectured at the Colloquium in the Fall of 1963. At that time, Gottfried had accepted my invitation for him to speak at Rutgers in the spring of 1964.</p>
              <p>When he failed to show at the railroad station, I got on the “blower” (navese for intercom) and found him in his office in College Park, Maryland: I had made a mistake—the talk was for the next week!</p>
              <p>Not to worry, <em>I took everybody to my house where we devoured the feast we had prepared for Gottfried</em>. The next week Gottfried arrived at the scheduled time—no more waiting—and after his beautiful lecture on functional analysis, we followed the script of the week before: <em>I took everybody over to my house for the feast we had prepared for Gottfried</em>. Only <em>this time</em> Gottfried had the chance to enjoy it with us! (It was a <em>quid pro quo</em> for the one he served us in Heidelberg four years earlier!)</p>
              <p>Isn’t this a bit surreal, like the Beckett play?</p>

              <p>His full name has this hyphenated form, as listed in “A Community of Scholars,” but people used Harish as a first name, i.e., given. I wish I had had the chance to have known Harish better. He had an ascetic quality and often stern visage that inhibited familiarity, although we often chatted with him at Institute socials, and his wife, Lily, was exceedingly friendly. (Harish may or may not have been a Brahmin, i.e., of the Indian ruling class: a carry-over of the Indian Caste system.) I have a photograph of Harish and Ed Nelson of the Princeton Mathematics Department, at an Institute dance. (They kindly posed for me.)</p>
              <p>Because of my gregarious nature, I think I may have irritated Harish one day in the library, when he sharply asked me to please be quiet! (I had not seen him or anybody else there.) I could never have spoken that way to anyone: because of the <em>third child syndrome</em>, I yield (or maybe rebel?) to everybody on command. (Ha!)</p>
              <p>But this is very unimportant—because of Harish’s mathematical accomplishments, he is deservedly revered: he won the American Mathematical Society’s prestigious Cole Prize in 1954 at age thirty-one, and some twenty years later he won India’s Mathematical Society’s Ramanujan prize.</p>
              <p>Sadly, Harish suffered a severe heart attack late in his 40’s, although he looked as thin as Mahatma Gandhi, and ate obviously low-fat food. (Nobody thought of those things, then!)</p>
              <p>After that he was much more accessible. Because of his daily regimen of walking around the 0.7 mile oval drive in front of Fuld Hall, <em>and</em> my own regimen of running the oval 3 times daily, we bumped into each other a lot, and Ima Dyson who also jogged, or Freeman Dyson walking to his nearby house off Battle road.</p>
              <p>Despite this, Harish died not many years after, in October 1983, just sixty years old. His death cast a deep pall over the Institute.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2692-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2692"><sup>32</sup></a> After the deaths of many great people, there is a sense of unreality, <em>a feeling that Harish still lives in a dimension beyond us</em>.

              <p>I want to record here this deep gloom I felt on a personal level. Even today when I walk around the oval I half-expect to see Harish coming around the bend carrying his omnipresent briefcase.</p>

              <p>Tea was the only beverage served at the afternoon teas at the Institute because Oswald Veblen objected to stronger stimulants. As one of the first professors to come to the Institute, he selected the setting for the Institute in the 600 acres of woods and fields he loved to walk in. He also designated 100 acres of his estate to form Mercer County (formerly called Veblen) Arboretum off Snowden Lane. Veblen was President of the American Mathematical Society 1923–1925.</p>
              <p>As a curiosity another professor of the Institute, Millard Meiss, in Historical Studies, left 100 acres of his land to the National Audubon Society, who ceded it to Princeton University for flora and fauna studies as well as preservation.</p>
              <p>Once it was opened to the public, I tramped across Meiss’ land with Professor Paul M. Cohn of the University of London who visited Rutgers in 69–70. Paul remarked it seemed such a waste of land! There is little open land in England since every available acre was used for farmland. I recalled the punning title of a hilarious movie “Tight Little Island”, about smuggled whisky. (“Whiskey is the Irish sort”—P.M. Cohn. Also, American!)</p>

              <p>At Rutgers in Fall 1962, I continued the course based on the <strong>Lectures</strong>, and once again I was lucky to have an excellent group of auditors Dick Bumby (a Ph.D. student of D. C. Spenser at Princeton), Bill Caldwell, Dick Cohn (a student of Ritt), Dick Courter, Harry Gonshor, Bob Heaton, Barbara Osofsky, Joe Oppenheim, and Earl Taft (a student of Nathan Jacobson), among others.</p>
              <p>I ought to mention here how I came to Rutgers. Like so many I fell in love with the rolling fields, Stony Brook and woods of the Institute (now preserved for posterity by the Institute Woods Preservation Fund), the colonial village of Princeton, and the proximity to the New Jersey shore on the East, the Poconos and Bucks County in Pennsylvania on the West, and New York and Philadelphia at the North and South Poles (so to speak).</p>
              <p>It’s a beautiful fact that the Institute’s Stony Brook flows into Princeton’s Lake Carnegie, formed by the confluence with the Millstone River which meanders north some 25 miles and empties into the Raritan on whose banks Rutgers University sits. Alongside these rivers run the Delaware and Raritan canals and the ancient towpath on which the commerce of New Jersey depended since Colonial Days.</p>
              <p>A former UK classmate of mine, Wilson Zaring, suggested that I apply to Rutgers when he invited me to his house to watch the Kentucky Derby and sip mint juleps. I had heard that Rutgers University in New Brunswick was not in the same league as Princeton, that is, the Ivy League, and not even in the same league as Purdue, namely the Big Ten (which Penn State subsequently joined). The upshot was, would I be interested in a job: Rutgers was looking and so was I!</p>

Subisomorphic divisible Abelian groups were known to be isomorphic, and in a parallel seminar on Abelian groups that Gonshor and I were conducting, the question arose as to the validity for injective modules. Bumby and Osofsky independently proved the answer was “yes,” and the proof ran vaguely along the lines of the proof of the Cantor-Bernstein Theorem for sets.</p>

              <p>Just as Barbara was preparing her thesis defense, I discovered a paper by L. A. Skornyakov which purported to prove her main theorem. Not to worry, Barbara found a mistake in his proof, and subsequently published “A counterexample to a lemma of Skornyakov.”</p>

The idea of the Faith-Utumi theorem was first published in rudimentary form in my Abstract of the American Mathematical Society for a meeting held in Cincinnati in the spring of 1961. By a stroke of luck Yuzo Utumi heard my lecture, and in the ensuing year and a half the Faith-Utumi Theorem (7.6A) was brought to light. It was the first in a series of 5 papers on which we collaborated and my second paper written at the Institute. Incredibly, this work was done totally via correspondence (via airmail not e-mail!). More than twenty-five years later we finally got together at Rutgers in Fall 1988 when he visited. At that time, Poobhalan Pillay, another collaborator of mine and I would be talking about Utumi’s theorems in the Rutgers Hill Center lounge in Utumi’s very presence but he evinced absolutely no interest. I believe that he was working in number theory, a subject relatively remote from our interest at the time, the little book listed in references published in Murcia in 1990. Shortly afterwards, Yuzo became ill and had to return to Japan.</p>

              <p>Jake (Yale U.), as everybody calls him, revolutionized ring theory by his papers and books. The essence of his approach was to generalize important concepts to rings “without finiteness assumptions,” e.g., in his paper <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid173-ref-0" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid173">45b</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>. I attended many of his splendid lectures at the University of Chicago where he lectured frequently at AMS meetings. They were nonpareil expositions, as are his many books.</p>
              <p>Jake was born in Warsaw in 1910, raised in Birmingham, Alabama, was a 1930 graduate of the State U. (home of The Crimson Tide), received his Princeton Ph.D. in 1934 under the direction of Wedderburn, was an assistant to Hermann Weyl at the Institute in 1934–35, and lectured at Bryn Mawr in 1935–1936, replacing Emmy Noether, who died during an optional routine operation in April 1935.</p>
              <p>Jake served as President of the American Mathematical Society (1971–73). A list of positions and honors bestowed and earned by him including National Academy of Science membership in 1960, are given in each volume of Jacobson’s Collected Papers <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid12-ref-39" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid12">89</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>. (Somehow his tenure as Chairman was omitted.)</p>
              <p>Jake received the Steele Prize for Distinguished Lifetime Achievement at the Annual Meeting of the Society in Baltimore in January 1998. Was there ever an award more deserved?</p>
              <p>When he became Emeritus Professor in 1981, his wife Florie told a group of 100 well wishers at a celebratory dinner at Yale “The best thing Jake ever did was marry me!” The audience and Jake greeted this with applause and laughter.</p>
              <p>Florie taught mathematics and “obtained her master’s degree with Otto Schilling, and was working for a doctorate under Adrian Albert” when they married in 1942 (to quote Jake, <em>op.cit.</em>, vol. I, p.5). She taught mathematics at Albertus Magnus, a college near Yale.</p>

This put the question of its falsity to rest, and brought us world-wide fame. Is it a coincidence that it was in the very same year (1964) that I received an offer from a Big 10 university as a full professor for a salary that almost doubled the maximum salary paid Rutgers professors? No, and I have Yitz to thank for recommending me.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2701-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2701"><sup>33</sup></a> The upshot was that Rutgers President Mason Gross was able to persuade the New Jersey legislature to revise Rutgers salaries to accommodate matching the Big 10 salaries.

              <p>Provost Richard Schlatter congratulated me on the offer, said he hoped I would stay, and that the Governor raised the question of whether New Jersey could afford a mathematics department! Dean Arnold Grobman wrote me a letter of commendation, and gave me a “Dean’s increment” in salary when I returned from my year (1965–1966) as visiting scholar at the University of California at Berkeley where I wrote <em>Algebra I</em>, and helped recruit our present chair Professor Antoni Kosinski (maybe the increment was for the latter!)</p>

              <p>Soon after the mathematics department moved into Hill Center in 1973, Shimshon spent a summer at Rutgers where he lectured on PI-algebras.

              <p>About this time, Amitsur had proved the existence of “uncrossed” (or noncrossed) division algebras (§2.5Dff), and when I told Atle Selberg about it, he arranged for Shimshon to lecture on this subject in Fuld Hall. Atle and Hetty gave a party for Shimshon that evening (Atle told me that the Amitsurs had feted him on his visit to Israel.)</p>
              <p>Here is an amusing and puzzling anecdote. On our walks, Shimshon professed not to know the names of the flowers. “Flowers are just flowers to me,” he protested. I found this attitude incredible (despite Shakespeare’s famous line about “a rose”!). When I told Atle, who knew the name of every wildflower, he said, “Knowing Amitsur, this does not surprise me.” (I am still puzzling over this twenty-five years later. Ironically Israel is a leading exporter of flowers to Europe.)</p>

              <p>Everybody knew the peripatetic Erdős: <em>Who travels lightest, travels farthest</em>. He came and went carrying just a briefcase, entrusting his hosts to supply the toilet articles and pajamas (somebody told me his PJ’s were in the briefcase). Someone (Henriksen?) told me this story at Purdue about Erdős. Once having outstayed his welcome at Tarski’s house in Berkeley, he returned one night to find himself locked out, and he banged at the doors and windows shouting: “Fascist!,”⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2715-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2715"><sup>34</sup></a> “Capitalist!”⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2716-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2716"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
              <p>Erdős was a member of the Institute 1938–1940.</p>
              <p>I first met Erdős as a 2nd or 3rd year graduate student back at Purdue in 1953–54, where he gave a colloquium lecture on number theory. He and Selberg earlier had independently discovered an elementary proof of the Prime Number Theorem (By coincidence, a story about this appears in the <em>Intelligencer</em>, June 1997.) I can’t recall if he was lecturing on it, but he used a term that sounded like oop-’sigh-Ion, <em>which everything was less than</em>. At the lecture I had supposed it was some universal constant! Later, to my dismay, I found that it was <em>epsilon</em> being used familiarly as an <em>infinitesimal</em>! This meshed with his epithet for children—he called them epsilons!</p>
              <p>Such was my earliest impression of one of the world’s greatest geniuses, who wrote more than 1000 (some say 1200) mathematical papers: No doubt many were co-authored by the local mathematicians, when he visited a day or two, leaving them to do the typing!</p>

              <p>Because of Erdős’ penchant for collaboration, it was conjectured that every mathematician has an <strong>Erdős number</strong>. Your Erdős number is 1 if you were a coauthor with Erdős, and 2 if you weren’t but were co-author with someone with Erdős number 1. The definition proceeds by mathematical induction! The conjecture has been disproved that every mathematician has an Erdős number <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-label="less than infinity" data-owns="2 0 1" style="vertical-align: -0.052ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="4.073ex" height="1.194ex" role="tree" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -547 1950.8 572" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g role="presentation" stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g role="presentation" data-owns-id="3"><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-label="blank" aria-setsize="3" aria-posinset="1" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="2"/><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-label="less than" aria-setsize="3" aria-posinset="2" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="0"><use role="presentation" xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-3C"/></g><g aria-hidden="true" role="treeitem" aria-label="infinity" aria-setsize="3" aria-posinset="3" aria-level="1" data-owns-id="1" transform="translate(997.8,0)"><use role="presentation" xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-221E"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$&lt;\infty$</span>.</span> When mathematicians tell me their Erdős number, I like to joke: well, what is your Gödel (girdle) number?

              <p>For many years Erdős offered cash prizes as inducements for solutions to unsolved problems. Ron Graham, a Rutgers Professor and Past President of the A.M.S., acts as Treasurer for Erdős’ prize funds and expenses.</p>
              <p>Erdős also founded the Budapest Semesters for gifted undergraduates, which Molly’s and my son, Japheth Wood, attended when he was a freshman at Washington U. in St. Louis. In May 1997 Japheth received his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in Universal Algebra under the guidance of Professor Ralph McKenzie. (His thesis was the proof that Type 2 and Type 4 minimal algebras are not computable.) I like to say that Erdős’ Budapest Semesters helped mature him at an early stage in his development, and that Ralph polished him up (or off?)</p>

Piatetski-Shapiro’s coming was an event of great significance! In Israel this meant <strong>coming from Russia, from behind the Iron Curtain;</strong> and then only after years of waiting for permission to leave.

There were many exchange visits with Jim, his wife Hanna, and his three sons in Montreal, when I lectured at McGill; New York, where he visited his mother; New Brunswick where he frequently addressed our colloquia and seminars.

              <p>As soon as my <strong>Lectures</strong> were published, I had the good luck to have them read by S. K. Jain (now at Ohio U., Athens) 13,000 miles away in New Delhi. At this time, the government of India under Indira Gandhi (Nehru’s daughter who married a Gandhi unrelated to the Mahatma) encouraged science development schools sponsored by the NSF and AID ( = Agency for International development). “S.K.”, as everybody calls him, organized a six weeks course (May-June) at the University of New Delhi, and as a consequence I was given the inestimable honor of lecturing to his students: Ram N. Gupta (now at Chandigarh), Saad Mohamed and Surjeet Singh, (both presently at Kuwait U.), Kamlesh Wasan, and <em>inter alios</em>, two students who came to Rutgers and in the early 70’s earned Ph.D.’s under my direction: Saroj Jain (Butler State U.) and Ranga Rao (U. of Aurangabad). Bhama Srinivasan also attended the lectures, and showed me a bit of Old Delhi.</p>
              <p>Professor Jain organized a train trip for the conferees to see the Taj Mahal in Agra and other Moslem buildings in nearby <em>Fatehpur Sikri</em>. Yes, the Taj is everything it is proclaimed to be—a veritable temple to love—by a prince to commemorate his wife who died. The original was bedecked with precious stones but these were stolen—like love often?</p>
              <p>Before leaving Delhi, we had the great honor of being invited to the wedding of Surjeet Singh. True to the Sikh tradition, it was a gala event replete with a circussized tent and an elephant. We experienced a great happiness being privileged to take part. Of course, Heidi was interested only in the elephant. She carried a camera we had given her—an Argus C-3—and when the film was developed the photographs were mostly animals—dogs, cats, horses, cows, and only one elephant.</p>

              <p>By another stroke of luck, there was a “rupee mountain” that needed to be melted. Because of India’s precarious economic health then, money that India paid for food imports and other necessities was not permitted out of the country, and could be spent by the U.S. only in India. Thus the term: rupee mountain.</p>

              <p>Accordingly, I was encouraged by Bill Orton, program director of the NSF in Delhi, to see a bit of India by lecturing in Jaipur, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta under the auspices of the NSF/USAID rupee mountain. The director of the Tata Institute, in Colaba, Bombay, was K. G. Ramanathan, whom I had met at the Institute (1961–62). Unknown to me, India was building an A-bomb, and the free atmosphere that I associated with universities was missing at Tata.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2727-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2727"><sup>37</sup></a> As always, I took pictures. <strong>That</strong> provoked the guards, but somehow K.G. was able to reassure them that, like Inspector Clouseau of Peter Sellers’ films, I was harmless, i.e., too stupid to be a spy! And he was right!!</p>
              <p>After Bombay came Madras, at the invitation of Bhama Srinivasan (now at U. of Illinois at Chicago Circle). Bhama was a gracious host and drove me and my family to see the Hindu Temple at <em>Mahabalipuram</em> (Seven Pagodas; also called Mamallipuram, or city of Malla), south of Madras. I was to meet Bhama again at the Institute for Advanced Study in the summer of 1977.</p>
              <p>After Madras, I visited Calcutta, and Banares, where they burn the bodies of the dead, and float them down the Ganges (Mother of India) River in funeral voyages.</p>

              <p>Once I was travelling through New Delhi in a taxi which ran out of gas. As I was in a hurry, I started to flag down another, but the driver gave me a horrified look and said, “Don’t do that! Don’t you realize that it was fate that brought us together and you will upset your karma if you take another taxi—something bad will happen to you.” So what could I do? Bowing to fate seemed the wisest thing to do. As we talked, the driver pushed his ultra lite cab around the corner, and as if by a miracle, there was a gasoline station that I hadn’t seen before. Within minutes, the tank was topped off and we were on our way as fate commanded.</p>
              <p>I had a similar experience in an Indian Coffee Shop where everybody spends hours in interminable debates over everything under the scorching Indian sun. (These are called Indian <em>muddles</em>.) I was suddenly approached by a young Indian who sat down and told me that he had been watching me at the coffee shop for several weeks. I said, “And?” “Well, you’re all right!” was the reply. And often I’ve asked myself, <em>suppose</em> I hadn’t been “all right”</p>
              <p>The concept of Karma is broader than just fate: <strong>You can change your fate through your good karma</strong>, that is, <strong>your goodness</strong>. This theory explains, I think, why some people “have all the luck.”</p>
              <p>Because of these experiences in India and others, even having the chance to visit India, and to see the Taj Mahal (one of the Wonders of the World), I have come to believe in Karma and the ability of all people to have good luck through it. (It reminds me a bit of the Golden Rule.)⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2729-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2729"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

              <p>He is the author of a distinguished biography of Mark Twain, and editor of “Papa”, a biography of Mark Twain by Twain’s thirteen-year-old daughter, Susy.</p>
              <p>The Neider’s named their own daughter Susy, and Charles wrote a memoir, “Susy, A Childhood,” about her. Neider has written extensively on Robert Louis Stevenson (“Our Samoan Adventure”), Franz Kafka (“The Frozen Sea”), and Washington Irving.</p>
              <p>In addition, Charles is an antarctic explorer and chronicler of the lives and exploits of Shackleton and Scott in his books on Antarctica; “Edge of the Earth: Ross Island Antarctica”; “Beyond the Horn: Travels in Antarctica”, and “Antarctica.”</p>
              <p>He has written a number of novels, <em>The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones</em> which was the basis of a movie “One-Eyed Jacks” starring Marlon Brando, two comic novellas, <em>The Trip to Yazoo, Mozart and the Archbooby</em> published by Penguin-Viking, <em>Overflight</em> about the crash on Mt. Erebus that he survived in 1956, and <em>The Left Eye Cries First</em> which is included in <em>The Grotto Berg</em>, published in 2001, the year of his death.</p>
              <p>Neider has enjoyed considerable support in his writings, especially the National Science Foundation supported his humanist interest in Antarctica and was amply rewarded by his exquisite prose descriptions. He also has been a visitor at McDowell, Yaddo, and the University of California at Santa Cruz.</p>

He was jubilantly showing his guests some beautiful amber, that had been found in New Jersey with embedded prehistoric mosquitoes. He later photographed the amber in a “dodge and burn” print which I purchased at a show of his photographs at Encore Books in 1996.</p>

              <p>On October 4, 1957, the USSR launched an earth satellite <strong>Sputnik</strong>, which in Russian means travelling companion (or fellow traveller?). This amazing accomplishment jolted the US awake to the fact that not only was the USSR far ahead of us in rocketry but also in science and technology education across the spectrum. This lead to massive expenditures by the US and the National Science Foundation to shore up academia by paying for libraries, laboratories, science equipment for buildings, and a new cadre of science teachers perhaps lured into science by NSF summer research grants equal to—first 1/3d, then—2/9th of our academic salaries. At a conference at Oberwolfach in July 1993, A. B. Mikhalev told me that the US mathematical and science community ought to thank the USSR for the good fortune that Sputnik brought us!</p>

              <p>Earl is one of Jacobson’s first five Ph.D. students (Yale 1956) and, like Jake, works in a broad spectrum of mathematics: associative and non-associative algebra, Lie algebras, Hopf algebras, cohomology, and quantum groups.</p>
              <p>Starting in 1959 when Earl came to Rutgers from Columbia U., Hessy worked at the prestigious Waksman⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2740-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2740"><sup>42</sup></a> Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University, and later in the newly founded Rutgers Medical School (now the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). Thereafter, she worked at the Educational Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton, where her expertise in chemistry and biology, and her fluency in five languages were highly prized. She worked unceasingly to maintain high standards for ETS (which meant bucking the trend that resulted in lower scores being adjusted upward!).</p>
              <p>Earl is the founding editor of the “Lecture Notes and Monographs in Pure and Applied Mathematics”⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2741-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2741"><sup>43</sup></a> and the journal “Communications in Algebra.” He too is proficient in five languages, and he likes to surprise his communicating editors by writing to them in their own language (maybe not Oriental languages though!).</p>
              <p>Hessy was born to Russian-speaking parents who fled via Germany to Paris, then to Cuba where she grew up. So counting English, there’s five languages right there (not counting Yiddish and Hebrew!)</p>
              <p>Earl is as New Yorker as you can be, having been born and raised there. Furthermore, they bought a house in Princeton with the smallest possible yard to minimize grass cutting! (I used to kid them about their love of nature! You can see for yourself—the house at 9 Robert Rd.)</p>
              <p>The Tafts are opera buffs who have subscribed to the Metropolitan Opera for forty years. They recently bought an apartment on Central Park West within walking distance of Lincoln Center.</p>
              <p>Once at a birthday party Earl threw for Hessy, I heard Hessy complain about their two-story apartment stairs. So I slyly remarked that, when that happens, it means the person is over thirty! This made her furious: then “thirty-something” was a despised classification. Do you remember the slogan “Never trust anybody over thirty”? But now? As Oliver Wendell Holmes remarked on his seventy-fifth birthday (when someone asked him how it <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline">felt)<svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠀⠄⠄⠄" aria-label="ellipsis" style="vertical-align: -0.017ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.852ex" height="0.255ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -114 887 122" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-2026"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$\ldots$</span>,</span> <em>Oh to be seventy again</em>!</p>
              <p>Earl was a member of the Institute in fall semesters 1973, 1978 and spring 1983. He also served as Treasurer for AMIAS⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2742-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2742"><sup>44</sup></a> for many years. As footnoted earlier, Earl was a “second cousin once removed” to the late Henny Youngman, master of the one-liner. For years, Earl kept me supplied for not only one-liners but his repertory of jokes. But my favorite story is one he told me about Hessy, when I complimented him on how vivacious she is: <em>she really wakes you up</em>. “Yes, Earl replied, “but she’s vivacious about <strong>everything</strong>. She doesn’t just say, “<em>Earl, take out the garbage</em>,” she says, “<em>Earl! Earl! Take out the garbage! Take out the garbage!</em>”</p>
              <p>Earl tells a romantic saga about a Scottish forebear named Taft who, with his brother were shipbuilders of Glasgow. On a business trip to Kiev, he met and fell in love with a Russian girl (<em>come to think of it, so did Earl!</em>).</p>
              <p>The other Taft brother came to the American colonies to seek his fortune, and there is some evidence that his descendants include the Ohio Taft clan, including our twenty-seventh president, William Howard Taft, and Senator Robert Alphonso Taft, who also ran for the GOP presidential nomination, but lost out to New York’s Thomas Dewey.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2743-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2743"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
              <p>As a remarkable coincidence, the Taft auditorium in Cincinnati, across the Ohio river from my native Covington, is a prominent cultural center, equal in its day, to the JFK Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.</p>

              <p>Everybody called him “Ken.” He was the Chair at Rutgers 1961–1976, and masterminded the development of the department. He asked each and every one in the department to recommend the best mathematicians to help build the Center of Excellence that the NSF contract with Rutgers funded. He would let you, as I did in the case of Antoni Kosinski, (who, by the way, is our present Chair) make the initial contacts, before he took over the heavy negotiations. The word genius is bandied about—how many can there be?—but Ken had a genius for talking to people, finding out what <em>they</em> wanted, letting them know what Rutgers <strong>would</strong> or <strong>could</strong> do for them. Obviously we couldn’t hire everybody we wanted. In Antoni’s case we were very lucky—how many people would leave Berkeley for New Brunswick? But actually, most of the people hired for the <em>Center of Excellence</em>, lived as Antoni and his wife Renate (Renate has a Ph.D. from Princeton) in Princeton, with its proximity to both Fine and Fuld Halls. And just one year after Antoni came, we raided Berkeley again and stole Glen Bredon!</p>
              <p>Ken was a Ph.D. student of Reinhold Baer at the University of Illinois, Urbana. <em>Two years after he obtained his Ph.D., Ken spent a year, 1954–5, at the Institute, exactly 20 years after Baer’s membership</em>.</p>

Also, fruitless offers went out to the Brandeis “twins”: Maurice Auslander and David Buchsbaum. For the record, we tried to persuade Jim Lambek to move to warmer climes but he declined without waiting for our offer. I think the fact that he and his three sons abhorred the Vietnam War, and U.S. militarism, was a factor in this decision.</p>

In those days I spent many afternoons at the Institute for lunch or tea, and one day I bumped into Vince in the Fuld Mathematics Library. (This must have been in Fall ’65 of his year at the Institute.) I had been admiring a new book, a Surveys of the A.M.S. (Vol.11) by Jane Scanlon (Cronin) at Brooklyn Poly, and I said “Vince, do you think she might be interested in an offer?” And Vince said, “I don’t know but I’d sure like to find out!” And that is how we came to make Jane an offer, which she accepted!

              <p>Roz taught English, including Shakespeare, at Highland Park High School and she taught the mathematics department many things about life: how to dance, to forget mathematics for an evening, to laugh at yourself, in short, to enjoy life.

              <p>This building, for the Mathematical Sciences, was partially built by the <strong>Centers of Excellence</strong> grant, and there used to be a plaque outside the 7th floor lounge and Colloquium Room commemorating this fact. (The trouble is that students like to take down insignia as memorabilia of their happy years at Rutgers. Recently someone took a crowbar to the door trying to get in to study on a cushy sofa.)</p>
              <p>When Peter Lax, of Courant Institute, was half-way through giving one of the four inaugural addresses, he stopped in his speech at a point where <em>Hill’s Equation</em> was mentioned, and idly asked if the Center was named after <em>that</em> Hill! <strong>Yes!</strong> was the instantaneous answer, for George William Hill (1838–1914) was not only a Rutgers professor at the turn of the 20th century, but his Collected Mathematical Works (in 4 quarto size volumes) has a 12-page introduction by Henri Poincaré and was published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1904.</p>
              <p>Most people think that the Center gets its name from the knoll it stands on.</p>

A Group Theory Year brought many of them to Rutgers including Walter Feit and John Thompson, whose oddorder theorem <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid23-ref-28" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid23">63</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group> gave CSG its impetus.

              <p>While at the University of Kentucky, I learned that Richard Brauer, one of the many mathematicians displaced by WWII in the “Intellectual Migration”, had been a visiting professor there several years earlier. But it was not until I attended an AMS meeting at Harvard in 1960 that I met him personally: I dropped by his office for a chat. (I think he was the chairman, at least his office had ‘chairman’ size!) After some time, I became aware of my imposition when he apologized to me for taking up so much of my time. (Was my face red!) I heard him lecture at the Institute for Defense Analyses in Princeton in the summer of 1964, on the subject of Simple Groups. Brauer was the humblest mathematician I ever met. He thanked you after his IDA lecture as if you were doing him a favor to attend his stimulating lecture! After the ICM in Stockholm in 1962, we visited Norway: Oslo, Bergen, Flam, and Balestrand on the Sogne Fjord. As I walked onto the ferry leaving Balestrand after viewing the glacier there, I bumped into Brauer and his wife. When I got back to the Institute for Advanced Study, I found a postcard from Brauer posted in Balestrand! (I mentioned this bit of inspiration in my Springer Algebra.)</p>

              <p>I started out writing about Danny’s contribution to excellence at Rutgers. Danny working closely with Rutgers University President Edward Bloustein, authored a master plan “Report on Higher Education in New Jersey,” informally called “The Gorenstein Report.” This was instrumental in establishing priorities for excellence in education. As Chair of the Department for many years, he did much to implement his own plan, e.g. I. M. Gelfand and his school came to Rutgers under Danny’s tenure.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2759-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2759"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
              <p>Out of curiosity I asked how his being Chair of the Department affected his research. He thought for a moment, and said, <em>I miss the dream time</em>. (Richard Lyons’ comment on this: “I bet he even dreamed at supersonic speed!”)</p>

            <section id="ltxid2760" data-ams-doc="section" data-ams-doc-level="1"><h2><span data-ams-doc="title">Helen and Danny</span></h2>
              
              <p>Helen and Danny Gorenstein were a delightful couple who liked to stroll up and down Nassau Street in Princeton and do a bit of window shopping. <em>How many times I chatted with them on this or that corner</em>. Other times we’d duck into PJ’s Pancake House for a “cuppa”, and range over the art world (Danny was a selfproclaimed “‘culture-vulture”), literature (Helen wrote an insightful biography of Leo Tolstoy ), and politics. We made it a point not to discuss mathematics when Helen was present.</p>
              <p>As a couple, Helen and Danny were a harmonious duet, Danny <em>allegro, molto vivace</em>, and at times <em>mezzo forte</em>, while Helen was <em>cantabile, piano and dolce</em>. Their daughter Julia and my daughter Cindy were great pals in their teens, and we were guests at birthday parties for both Danny and Helen, in their home on Philip Drive. Later when they moved to Rocky Hill to free up capital to buy their summer house on the Vineyard, we <em>still</em> saw them strolling in Princeton, and kidded them about “life in the boonies”. They both had a great sense of humor, but in that too the same musical terms were descriptive.</p>
              <p>The Gorensteins’ avid interest in art matched mine. It was not unusual for me to attend an art opening in New York—Modern Art, Metropolitan, Guggenheim, Whitney, or Princeton Art Museum, and find the two of them there. They also were familiars at McCarter Theater productions and Institute socials.</p>
              <p>Danny was a member of the Institute in 1969–70—the year before his coming to Rutgers, and also the year of the first Moon Walk by Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969.</p>
              <p>Perhaps a defining moment in Danny and Helen’s relationship came while we were having coffee in PJ’s. I had been reading about the Tolstoy’s stormy relations, and something popped up that Helen didn’t know about. This upset Danny a lot, and he verbally chastised Helen for not having been thorough enough in her research. Here, I would guess <em>he was applying to life and literature the same standard of rigor that he applied in mathematics</em>; while I didn’t think that he should do that, a chastened Helen acquiesced. Not to worry—soon afterwards, at the Princeton Book Mart (now out-of-business), I saw Helen clutching a new book on Tolstoy by a well-known Russian literary critic (Ronald Hingley?), and with shining eyes Helen confided, “Danny said I could buy it!”</p>
              <p>On Sundays out for a stroll, Helen and Danny often stopped by our house on Longview Drive on Lake Carnegie and would take a glass of wine with us. I treasure these memories of an affectionate friendship.</p>
              <p>In spring 1972, I had the greatest pleasure of telling Danny of my having just served on the Fulbright committee in Washington, D. C. that awarded him his Fulbright to Oxford (1972–73). He said incredulously, <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline">“<em>You?</em><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠀⠄⠄⠄" aria-label="ellipsis" style="vertical-align: -0.017ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.852ex" height="0.255ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -114 887 122" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-2026"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$\ldots$</span></span> were on the selection committee?”</p>
              <p>Danny’s incredulity was later echoed by a real estate broker I knew who belatedly found out that I owned a house on the lake: “<em>You</em> have a house, on the lake?” (Previously had she thought I was a mathematical poor mouse? As a matter of fact, we do have the cheapest house on the lake!)</p>

              <p>Ken Goodearl (University of California, Santa Barbara) visited us at Rutgers in Fall 1976 (the year of the U. S. Bicentennial), while he wrote his classic <em>Von Neumann Regular Rings</em>. A happy aspect of his visit was that he lived in Princeton at the nearby Vandeventer Apartments,⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2762-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2762"><sup>49</sup></a> on the street with the same name, so occasionally we carpooled. Another happy aspect of his visit was his interaction with Joseph (Joe) Johnson and John Cozzens in differential algebra that they mutually exploited. They passed the differentials around and Joe combined a result of Goodearl that enabled him to solve a 50-year-old problem of M. Janet in differential equations (DE’s). Goodearl, however, insisted that he owed the basic idea to a paper of Cozzens and Johnson on DE’s. (A little bit like the double play combination. Tinkers to Evers to Chance.)⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2763-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2763"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
              <p>Ken gave a memorable colloquium on von Neumann regular rings. After the talk, I asked him if all that derived from the question about simple self-injective rings that I raised in my (Springer) <em>Lectures</em>. Ken thought for a moment, and then smiled and said “Yes”. I think he had completely forgotten the background. There is so much to remember and to relate that to give the history in detail would take up more time than we have in an hour’s lecture. (If you want to know the question of mine that Ken answered, see the title of his 1974 paper.)</p>

              <p>The same thing happened to me when at the 1964 Summer Meeting of the AMS in <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline">Boulder<svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠀⠄⠄⠄" aria-label="ellipsis" style="vertical-align: -0.017ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.852ex" height="0.255ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -114 887 122" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-2026"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$\ldots$</span>I</span> referred to a “Theorem of C. Hopkins”. It so happened that S. A. Amitsur was an auditor and in the question period following the lecture he stated that Levitzki had proved it independently.</p>
              <p>The reason for this glip was that the Hopkins’ paper appeared in 1939 in the prestigious <em>Annals of Mathematics</em>, published jointly by the Institute and Princeton University, whereas Levitzki’s paper, submitted to <em>Compositio Mathematica</em> in 1939, did not appear until after the end of world War II. However, when published, the journal carried the original fateful date—1939, the year Hitler invaded Poland and the Allies declared war on Nazi Germany.</p>

              <p>For this reason many Americans knew <em>only</em> the work of Hopkins, and I was one!

              <p>Unfortunately nobody followed my lead in this nomenclature, and later I adopted the shorter appellation: <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline">acc<svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠫⠏" aria-label="perpendicular" style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.48ex" height="1.415ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -678 709 678" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-27C2"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$\perp$</span></span> rings.

              <p>A student of Levitzki at Technion, Benyamin Schwarz, wrote to me a moving letter, thanking me for my glowing references to Levitzki, saying that he had no idea that Levitzki was so revered outside Israel.

Luckily for me, I soon discovered two members, Charles (Chuck) Weibel and Anthony Vito Geramita, who were inexhaustible sources of knowledge of commutative algebra. Chuck then was a new Chicago Ph.D. student (of Richard Swan) and already exhibited the incredibly deep knowledge that not many years later landed him the prestigious Editorship of the <em>Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra</em> (no connection with the Dekker Lecture Notes), the successor to Hy Bass, one of the founding editors.</p>
              <p>In my <em>Lectures</em> (<em>ibid</em>., p.66) I duly acknowledged “that I fleeced trade secrets off of Tony Geramita and Chuck Weibel [who let me know that they had plenty left!].</p>

              <p>Chuck had applied to Rutgers for a job, which was more or less <em>de rigueur</em>, since in those days jobs did not grow on trees as they had in the 50’s and 60’s. But did my urging the Personnel Committee to grab Weibel have an effect? Well, no, but this was not Weibel’s fault since they had a priority list: <em>let there be Algebraic Topology</em> (for instance), <strong>or</strong> (maybe) <em>Applied Mathematics</em>.</p>
              <p>Bad luck! But next year the same priorities prevailed, and again we did not make Chuck the offer. Worse luck!</p>
              <p>Not to worry. The third time was the charm. Barry Mitchell showed up at the Personnel Committee meeting, and said, “Hire Weibel!” <em>And so they did</em>! So thank Karma (or Kismet) again, and also Barry!</p>
              <p>I can vouch for the fact that Chuck is one of the most popular faculty members in mathematics by the fact that <em>three years later the tenure vote was unanimous</em>.

              <p>Poo, as he liked to be called, came to visit me at Rutgers in the academic year 1979–1980. He was then a recent Ph.D. from the U. of Johannesburg, who taught at the segregated University of Durban, Westville. He came to Rutgers supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from South Africa, showing up on Labor Day weekend obviously expecting to find housing in the by then very tight college market! I lodged him in Nassau Inn in Princeton and gave him a telephone number of a local realtor. Within days he found a wonderful, big duplex house, with a large yard for his two children Khandon and Kanyakumari, on Mt. Lucas Road in Princeton. In this instance Karma exerted great force in my behalf, because the house was next door to Molly Sullivan, whom I met several days later standing in Poo’s front yard balancing a mattress on her head, native style, that she had acquired for the Pillays at a nearby rummage sale.</p>
              <p>A golden September light illuminated the trio, Molly, Poo, and his wife Lalita, and Molly was swaying slightly in a soft breeze that ruffled the skirt of my future wife. I might never had met Molly if I had not hosted Poobhalan at Rutgers on his Equal Rights Fellowship. Nor would I have had the opportunity to know her, had I not driven Poo to Rutgers thrice weekly, stopping by for tea on the return, where frequently we found Molly there chatting with Lalita.</p>
              <p>It was another instance when the Indian Goddess Karma smiled down on us: after a long courtship, Molly and I were married in September 1987, eight years almost to the day we first met.</p>
              <p>Poo and his family returned again in 1988–1989, when we wrote our little book <em>Classification of Commutative FPF Rings</em>, published in 1990 by the University of Murcia, Spain.

Before long they were fast friends—Rosie called him “Tommy” and he loved it.</p>
              <p>Tommy and I got on famously. As we drove in my car from Princeton to Hill Center in Piscataway, we would sing American songs of the 30’s and 40’s. When I asked him how come he knew so many of my favorites, he said, “<em>Why, from Tokyo Rose!</em>”</p>
              <p>For the younger generation: Tokyo Rose was an American Radio Announcer for Japan propaganda in World War II. She sang nostalgic songs to undermine the American morale, but it had the opposite effect: the troops loved her, as I loved Tommy singing her songs.</p>

              <p>So you might say that I was well prepared for the course, but alas, except for Ted Faticoni, nobody was prepared to hear them! Ted was a student of Visonhaler at U Conn (as it’s called), and took to this abstruse subject like the proverbial duck took to water. We had long wide-ranging conversations on the subject that proved immensely stimulating to me, and inspired Ted to write a series of important papers (see references, and also Theorem <span class="refgroup" data-ams-refrange="null" data-ams-ref="null" data-ams-doc="refgroup"><a data-ams-ref="statement" href="../Text/Part-0014.xhtml#ltxid1172">5.46</a></span>).⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2772-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2772"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
              <p>Another happy aspect of my life in Las Cruces was that, after Molly and the children returned to Princeton in March, I was “invited” to move into the guestroom of the Walkers. (Invited may not be the proper word! Think of the anecdote about Erdős and Tarski that I related earlier.) To put it another way, I so much wanted to live with them that they kindly assented. The name of the street they live on—Imperial Ridge—conveys something of the spacious grandeur of the house. The guest room was off the first level rec room and dining room areas. The latter location got me invited to several fine dinners and Elbert’s 50th birthday celebration!</p>
              <p>Here is another instance of good karma! As we Kentuckians like to say—I was living in “hog heaven”! The Walkers are the most genial and generous of people—Elbert is a Texan to his boots and Huntsville roots, and Carol hails from Martinez, California. I owe them both a great debt of gratitude for their hospitality and kindness: I would not have been able to stay on in Las Cruces without the friendships of the Walkers and the Faticoni’s.</p>

One windy day in March we watched in amazement when during a sandstorm huge ominous tumbleweeds wheeled out of the desert. New Mexico, in particular, and the arid southwest USA in general, is not for sissies! The wind blows constantly, often with tornado force. But beautiful—I will never, ever, forget the awesome beauty of those six-foot high tumbleweeds.</p>

By the vagaries of life, in 1945, I was stationed in Corpus Christi at the Naval Air Base there, smack dab on the Gulf, not far from Matamoros!

              <p>These two visited us at Rutgers in the academic year of 1993–1994. I attended Dolors’ Ph.D. Thesis Defense at Autońoma U. of Barcelona in January 1992, and subsequently she was awarded a Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellowship to study at Rutgers, starting exactly one year later in January 1993. Ahmad (American U. of Beirut) also visited but kept a low profile in Fall ’93, but finally in January 1994, I wrote him a polite note saying I would like to start a seminar with him, Dolors, and Barbara Osofsky.

              <p>I happened to run into Arthur, and his artist-wife Marta, on a field trip to Strasbourg taken by the conferees at the Oberwolfach Ring Theory Conference in July 1993. It was a hot day and the cool air of the cathedral was refreshing so I joined Arthur sitting on a pew while Molly and Marta continued their tour of the cathedral. This was the first chance I had to talk to Arthur since the Exeter conference in 1984 (see below). I asked him if he ever had taken a sabbatical, found out that one was long overdue and invited him to spend part of it at Rutgers. He came in October 1994 (right after Dolors Herbera left) for a two month visit and worked on two papers while there: “<em>Almost Principal Ideal Rings</em>” and “<em>Near Dedekind Rings</em>” appearing in 1998 and 2000. (See Refs. I have Arthur to thank for refreshing our memory in his e-mail of January 2002.)</p>
              <p>Arthur and Marta shared Thanksgiving with our family and Molly baked turkey with all the trimmings. Our son Ezra was planning for his “Junior Year Abroad” from Rutgers, and hearing this, Arthur persuaded him of the advantages of Bristol, Arthur’s university. It worked out wonderfully for Ezra who made all A’s there, except one B, and was given “Outstanding Athlete Award” for his exploits in Ultimate Frisbee.</p>
              <p>I was happy to persuade Marta to sell me one of her paintings “Mangoes”. (I have my eye on another of her colorful paintings “Animation Autour du Vin” but I haven’t been able to persuade her to part with it.) She is a fine artist and gives international shows, e.g. in France, where she spends a month each summer “autour du vin” for inspiration.</p>

              <p>It would be impossible to fully express in this brief space the debts of friendship, both personal and mathematical, that I owe to the late Pere Menal Brufal.</p>
              <p>It all began in 1981, when I wrote to Pere about his work <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid5-ref-29" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid5">81</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group> on algebraic regular rings in connection with tensor products. He expressed amazement and delight that it was connected with the Hilbert <em>Nullstellensatz</em>. (See, e.g. my paper in his Memorial Volume (Perelló <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid82-ref-23" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid82">92</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>.))</p>
              <p>After some years of correspondence, we began contemplating an algebra semester under the auspices of Manuel Castellet’s CRM, and they went on to organize one in spring 1986; another much larger conference followed in Fall 1989.</p>
              <p>Much creative mathematics flowed out of these conferences, particularly the theorem of Pere Menal and Peter Vámos <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid12-ref-40" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid12">89</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group> that realized a three decades-old dream of ring theory: an embedding of any ring in an FP-injective ring. In her Rutgers University Ph.D. thesis (1964), Barbara Osofsky had shown that in general the injective hull of a ring <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠠⠗" aria-label="upper R" style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.294ex" height="1.372ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -657 620 657" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D445"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$R$</span></span> could not be made into a ring containing <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠠⠗" aria-label="upper R" style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.294ex" height="1.372ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -657 620 657" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D445"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$R$</span></span> as a subring.

              <p>In the 1989 semester, Pere and I collaborated on a problem that eluded us individually for many years, and we finally found what we were looking for: “A counter-example to a conjecture of Johns” which appeared in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society in 1991, shortly after his tragic death in an automobile accident in April. Cf. the Pere Menal Memorial Volume (C. Perelló, General Ed.; M. Castellet, W. Dicks, J. Moncasi, Volume Eds.): Publ. Math. <strong>36</strong> (1992).</p>
              <p>These are just two of the myriad collaborations that Pere Menal had with others: Jaume Moncasi, Pere Ara, Claudi Busqué, Ferran Cedó, Dolors Herbera, Rosa Camps (his talented students and colleagues) and Warren Dicks, Brian Hartley, Kenneth Goodearl, Robert Raphael, the aforementioned Peter Vámos, Boris Vaserstein (to mention but a few of his intense interactions with others).</p>
              <p>In particular, Pere’s paper with Dolors Herbera <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid12-ref-41" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid12">89</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>, Ferran Cedó’s paper <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid14-ref-33" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid14">91</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>, Dolors Herbera’s paper with Poobhalan Pillay <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid99-ref-20" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid99">93</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group>, and her doctoral thesis, and that of Rosa Camps, at U.A.B., each greatly advanced our knowledge on subjects taken up in seminars during these conferences.</p>
              <p>I am grateful that I happened to write to Pere back in 1981; otherwise, I might never have met this noble and gentle genius of Catalunya, who became an inspiration to many.</p>

              <p>I met Alberto at the Exeter conference in June 1984 on “Direct Sum Decompositions” organized by Peter Vámos. When I was asked by Pere Menal to help organize the Algebra Conference at Centre Recerca Matematica (CRM) at Autónoma University of Barcelona in spring 1986, I nominated both Alberto and Peter for my short list, which included Ken Goodearl and his mentor Robert Warfield, Barbara Osofsky, Roger Wiegand, and Sylvia Wiegand. (The latter five could not attend either because of previous engagements or family illness.)</p>
              <p>Again, in the following conference at CRM in Fall 1989, we invited the same seven, in addition to the others listed above in my reminiscence about Pere Menal, only to receive the terrible news of the death of Robert Warfield. Pere, newly editor of Communications in Algebra, dedicated a volume in memory of Robert (this came out in 1991).</p>

            <section id="ltxid2780" data-ams-doc="section" data-ams-doc-level="1"><h2><span data-ams-doc="title">Barcelona and Bellaterra</span></h2>
              
              <p>Autónoma University of Barcelona (UAB) is located some 20 miles north of central Barcelona in a valley appropriately named <em>Bellaterra</em> (beautiful land). It was put there by Generalissimo Franco because student protests in central Barcelona not only disrupted traffic but also gave out too much anti-Franco propaganda.</p>
              <p>First and foremost, Catalunya (also called Catalonia) relished its historical independence, language, and the culture that they had had before Spain conquered them. They considered it their patriotic duty to rebel against Franco. Second, they were fervid anti-fascists, at least against Spanish fascism, so their protests served to weaken the Franco <em>regime</em>. Consequently Franco put UAB out in the country, what we would call the <em>Boonies</em>, and said, “Let the cattle watch them protest!”</p>
              <p>To get to Bellaterra, you take the <em>Ferrocarril</em> (literally, iron rail) through a breathtaking series of hills, valleys and tunnels that would do justice to Morse Theory! The little villages en route have poetical Catalán names such as La Floresta (flowers) and Valdoreix (“Reix” is pronounced “resh;” but don’t forget to trill the <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline">“<svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠠⠗" aria-label="upper R" style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.294ex" height="1.372ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -657 620 657" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D445"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$R$</span>”:</span> I once challenged Jaume Moncasi to pronounce <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠠⠗" aria-label="upper R" style="vertical-align: 0;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.294ex" height="1.372ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -657 620 657" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-I-1D445"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$R$</span></span> without a trill, and he managed only with great difficulty!)⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2781-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2781"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
              <p>After the beautiful train ride to Autónoma, the University comes as a shock. The gray buildings were all poured concrete monstrosities (called the <em>new brutal</em> in the USA) that only a fascist architect could dream up to dispirit the students and faculty. It looked more like a prison than a university (the new buildings in the 90’s are of colorful brick).</p>
              <p>Autónoma University differs from the University of Barcelona in central Barcelona in that Catalán is the language spoken at Autónoma, Spanish is spoken in the University of Barcelona. (Actually, Autónoma <em>could be</em> translated as “provincial,” “regional,” or “state,” although autonomy is a cognate.) The Catalán history is of a proud and independent people who once ruled much of the Mediterranean and parts of the “New World,” e.g., Cuba. Catalunya (Catalonia) had its own constitution over 1,000 years ago, and Catalán is recognized as an “autonomous” language.</p>
              <p>American visitors to Barcelona recognize a kinship to the bristling industrial vitality of the region that more resembles nordic New York than romantic Madrid; Catalunya is by far the most prosperous of all the Spanish autonomous states, and attracts legions of job seekers from the rest of Spain.</p>

              <p>Beyond its economic power, Barcelona is also noted for its artistic and cultural heritage. The great architect, Gaudí, left his indelible imprint on the city with his world famous <em>Familia Sagrada Cathedral</em>⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2783-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2783"><sup>55</sup></a> that dominates the skyline, numerous revolutionary buildings with curving facades, gargoyles and multicolored tiles, and the exquisite Parque Güell that overlooks the port city from its perch in Lesseps, a barrio (suburb) where we lived.</p>
              <p>During our annual visits to Barcelona in the decade 1986–1996, we lived in an apartment adjacent to Parque Güell, and like all who go there, fell under the spell of Gaudí’s genius. The best way to describe Parque Güell is an enchanting fairyland of balustrades, winding paths, colonades, castles, grottoes, and delightful outdoor cafes where you can snack while you soak it all up.</p>
              <p>How many days did we walk over to the park and watch the cargo ships floating in the Mediterranean due east of the city: <em>Mare Nostrum</em> (our sea) is what Caesar called it. Although on the same latitude as New York, Barcelona’s climate resembles that of Los Angeles—semitropical, semiarid, sunny, and delightful except for the frequent smog.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2784-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2784"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

            <section id="ltxid2785" data-ams-doc="section" data-ams-doc-level="1"><h2><span data-ams-doc="title">The Ramblas</span></h2>
              
              <p>The Ramblas may well be the world’s most famous promenade. It originates in the harbor area and cuts the city in two with its broad mall that stretches a mile due west, ending a bit past Plaza Catalunya, where it bifurcates into two ramblas!</p>
              <p>Words can hardly describe the cornucopia of bookstores, outdoor cafes, and businesses that dot the promenade. Each area has its own flavor—this one (Rambla de Flors) selling flowers, another parakeets, yet another selling jewelry!</p>
              <p>In addition to the bustle of the pedestrians, there are the countless mimes, one imitates a stoic Roman soldier, while another mimics the gaits and facial expressions of passersby. The strains of Peruvian music fill the air with its prehistoric music. Monkeys or horses, or bears perform brilliant feats for their masters. Gypsies dance their ancient rituals of passionate love, while pickpockets prey on the unwary watchers.</p>
              <p>You have to pay a small fee to sit in a nearby chair, but, if you did, then you wouldn’t be able to see anything but the backs of the delighted throngs.</p>
              <p>You don’t need any license to perform on the Ramblas, and so impecunious students and travellers pull out their musical instruments, or just break out in song, hoping for a few pesetas to fall into the hat placed in front of them on the ramblas.</p>
              <p>Once at Madison Square Garden in New York, the ringmaster of Ringling Brothers sang a catchy ditty “May Every Day be Circus Day.” When you walk on the Ramblas—<em>every day is Circus Day</em>!</p>

            <section id="ltxid2786" data-ams-doc="section" data-ams-doc-level="1"><h2><span data-ams-doc="title">Norman Steenrod</span></h2>
              
              <p>By coincidence, Norman Steenrod, who was a Princeton neighbor of mine, rode the train back to Princeton after the AMS Cincinnati meeting in spring 1961 where I met Utumi. We shared an aversion to flying, and settled into an overnighter train back to Princeton. I made a voluminous entry into my diary covering the wide-ranging conversations that I had with him. Prom memory, however, I recall that he explained why the Princeton Mathematics Department did not have course requirements for the Ph.D. degree. “We don’t want a student taking courses and making A’s to think that is what we want him or her to do. We don’t want him or her to limit their studies to just making good grades in courses. So our generals (exams), explore the depth and range of his or her inquiries.”</p>
              <p>The fact that Princeton perennially (as presently) ranks number 1 in their mathematics graduate school attests to their success.

              <p>Another recollection that I have of these conversations on the train is the origin of the term “injective” which according to Steenrod was first used in a book on algebraic topology in 1952, co-authored with Samuel Eilenberg. “We left a space in the text until we finally decided what to call it!”, Steenrod explained.</p>

              <p>After a Colloquium lecture at Rutgers by Irving (“Kap”) Kaplansky, we gave a party for him in Princeton, which both Steenrod and Borel attended. I distinctly remember the pleasure that Kap exuded when he discovered them <em>both</em> at my house after the colloquium dinner. “Norman <em>and</em> Armand!”, he exclaimed with obvious delight. My graduate students Vic Camillo and John Cozzens beamed with pleasure at this “summit meeting” of intellectuals. In particular, Vic recalls Kap telling him apropos of topology and algebra “<em>It pays to know more than one subject</em>” Kap admonished.</p>
              <p>John Cozzens almost immediately applied Kap’s advice: He came to me one day and said, “Carl, I could get a differential field over which I could solve these blankety-blank equations.” I knew then that John had his Ph.D. because I had read Kap’s monograph <cite-group><ams-x>[</ams-x><cite><a id="texmlid68-ref-19" epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-ams-ref="bibr" href="../Text/Part-0029.xhtml#texmlid68">57</a></cite><ams-x>]</ams-x></cite-group> in which I learned of Kolchin’s universal differential fields.</p>

              <p>Kaplansky regularly visited Rutgers over the thirty-five years that I was on the faculty. Sometimes his visits were unofficial in that he was visiting a relative in the engineering department. But when he gave a colloquium, you had to get there early if you expected to get a seat—he was one of our most popular speakers. (Jack Milnor and Armand Borel were two others who lectured to overflow audiences.)</p>
              <p>Kap was a member of the Institute in 1946–1947 and a professor at the University of Chicago for over thirty years before following S.S. Chern as director of the Mathematical Sciences Institute at Berkeley, which he relinquished to William Thurston, followed by David Eisenbud in 1997.</p>
              <p>Kap was President of the American Mathematical Society 1985–87. A stimulating introduction to Kap’s mathematical life and thought appears in <em>More Mathematical People</em> (See Bibliography, Albers et al., eds.)</p>

              <p>At the Annual Meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Orlando in January 1996, Kap gave his (postponed) retiring presidential address with the above title. Here’s a quote:</p>
              <p>As I look out at the audience, I wonder how many spotted the title? <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline"><svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠀⠄⠄⠄" aria-label="ellipsis" style="vertical-align: -0.017ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.852ex" height="0.255ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -114 887 122" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-2026"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$\ldots$</span>in</span> Act II, Scene I, line 322 of “The Taming of the Shrew,” Petruchio has successfully wooed Katherine (if “wooed” is the right word), and as the wedding impends, he tells her “We shall have rings and things and a fine array.”</p>
              <p>The phrase was brought to my attention by my children. When they were young they at times told their friends that their daddy worked on rings and things. I believe that they did not know they were quoting Shakespeare.</p>
              <p>The late Einar Hille once remarked that wherever he looked in mathematics he managed to see semigroups of operators. I feel the same way about rings.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2790-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2790"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
              <p>Kap goes on to quote Bourbaki’s historical note on commutative algebra saying that “the general notion of ring is probably that of Fraenkel in 1914.”</p>
              <p>The entire address is replete with history, and ought to be made to be required reading, if only we could persuade Kap to publish it! I want to pause here to thank a mutual friend at Berkeley (who prefers anonymity!) for sending a copy to me.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2791-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2791"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

Although this was a highly complicated subject, Sammy engaged the audience with eye contact, asking for and getting affirmative responses to his propositions, simultaneously raising himself up on the ball of his right foot with his right arm outstretched in a balletic, almost physical, delivery.</p>
              <p>As a balletomane, I took delight in the grace and skill of his movements which accentuated the <em>act of physically delivering his ideas to the audience</em>. Afterwards at dinner (at McAteers on Easton Avenue) he confirmed my conjecture as to his ballet training as a youth.</p>
              <p>Regarding his zestful sexagenarian enjoyment of food and wine at dinner, Sammy confessed, “I just had my annual physical and the doctor gave me a clean bill of health, so <strong>full speed ahead</strong>!”</p>

              <p>Sammy was an internationally recognized connoiseur and avid collector of Indian and Southeast Asian art, which he saw for the first time on his trip to Bombay in 1953 to teach mathematics for a semester. Over the next 35 years, Sammy collected bronzes and stone artifacts in India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, as well as in Europe. He donated over 400 of these to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and 187 were chosen for an exhibit in 1991–1992 at the Museum entitled “The Lotus Ranscendent.” Other artifacts were donated to Columbia University, who sold them to the Museum to endow a named professorship of mathematics in his honor (from an article in the <em>New York Times</em>, October 21, 1991, by Rita Rief, entitled “How a Trip to India Turned a Professor into a Collector”).</p>
              <p>Sammy told me that he had acquired so much Indian art that the airport customs officials were put on “red alert” whenever he entered the country in a vain attempt to thwart his smuggling. He was quite delighted by his ability to evade them.</p>

              <p>At McAteers Restaurant, Sammy explained to everybody the success of Jewish mathematicians, beginning with Einstein, this way: “<em>It was the only thing they would let us do</em>!” I think this is a most profound insight into the astonishing quality of Jewish culture (which Einstein said made him proud to be Jewish),⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2797-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2797"><sup>59</sup></a> and one might add, in retrospect of the holocaust: <em>and then they wouldn’t even let us do that</em>.</p>
              <p>The late Maurice (“Moe”) Auslander once told me “<em>They (the Nazis) wouldn’t let you be anything else</em> [but Jewish].” The Holocaust has to be the saddest chapter in world history.

              <p>Emil Artin was the only mathematician to solve two of Hilbert’s problems: the Ninth and the Seventeenth.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2799-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2799"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
              <p>Among his many great theorems is the Wedderburn-Artin Theorem, which systematized the study of “Artinian” rings, that is, rings with the descending chain condition on ideals.</p>
              <p>Artin’s delightful little book <em>Galois Theory</em> introduced a generation of mathematicians to the mysteries of solutions of polynomial equations over commutative fields. Danny Gorenstein told me that Artin’s book was the model for his own book “Finite Simple Groups.” “I tried to make the subject as accessible as Artin made Galois Theory,” Danny said to me when I professed my debt to the latter, beginning with my Ph.D. thesis, for starters.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2800-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2800"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
              <p>In 1958, I wrote to Artin at Princeton University to ask if I could work with him. The reply was, Yes, but I would have to come to Hamburg, where he had returned. Like Reinhold Baer, and at about the same time, he had become repatriated in Germany.</p>
              <p>The proposal did not work out because the NSF postdoctoral fellowship that I applied for was not to be, although Yitz Herstein had told me, when he came to Penn State for a colloquium, that I had been top-rated for the post-doctoral. For some reason the NSF had reversed the committee rankings.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it may have worked out for the best, since I was able to obtain, again with Herstein’s support, the Fulbright-Nato postdoctoral to Heidelberg in 1959–1960. Sadly, however, Emil Artin died in 1962, and I, and the rest of the world, forever lost the chance to work with this great mathematician.</p>
              <p>Often I run into his widow, Natalie (actually, Natascha) Jasny, in a supermarket, or just walking on Nassau Street, and when I do, I always ask after her children, Karin and Michael, who live in Cambridge. (Another son, Thomas, I never met.) She still lives in the family home on Evelyn Place, one of the architectural treasures of Princeton.</p>

At a Rutgers colloquium lecture some years ago he went to great pains to explain that his wife bought his beautiful sport shirt. Everybody enjoyed the comedy. Mike explained to me the Armenian origin of the family name, Artinian, which had been shortened in Germany and the United States. By the vagaries of life, the name Artinian was restored in adjectival form by Bourbaki: Artinian rings!⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2803-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2803"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
              <p>The Artins or Artinians are true mathematical royalty despite the assertion by Euclid: there is no royal road to geometry. Mike was President of the American Mathematic Society 1991–93.</p>
              <p>I was privy to a conversation between Mike Artin and Bill Browder, who was then Chair of the Princeton University Mathematics Department. It went something like this:</p>
              <p>Bill: Mike, are you ready to return to Princeton?</p>
              <p>Mike: No, not yet.</p>
              <p>Bill: Well, let me know when you are.</p>
              <p>Mike: I will, Bill, I will.</p>
              <p>This reminds me of the negotiations of the Institute’s Founding Director Abraham Flexner with Albert Einstein regarding salary. Flexner asked Einstein how much he wanted. Einstein thought for a moment and said $3,000. That settled it—Flexner instead gave him $10,000. (This story is elaborated in Ed Regis’ book <em>Who Got Einstein’s Office</em>, p.22.)</p>

              <p>Thus did serendipity bring Bob Bonic and me together in the same office—all the other offices at the Institute were private.

            <section id="ltxid2806" data-ams-doc="section" data-ams-doc-level="1"><h2><span data-ams-doc="title">Some Cafés and Coffee Houses</span></h2>
              
              <p>Bob Bonic and I frequently met in the Balt or Renwicks for coffee, rolls, or lunch, and I got to know people of Princeton beyond the Institute.</p>
              <p>In later years (1968), after the Balt, and then Renwick’s closed, and Bob left the Institute, I gravitated to the newly opened PJ’s Pancake restaurant, and at least one other mathematician, Solomon Bochner, gravitated with me. Other habitués were Walter Kaufmann, Louis Fischer and Erich Kahler, who wrote <em>The Disinherited Mind</em>.</p>
              <p>“Coffee housing” was a tradition that I adopted at the Corner Room in State College, when I taught at Penn State, letting the good conversation and the aroma of coffee percolate through the brain. Luckily the owner and manager, Herb Tuchman, is a pleasant indulgent man, and most of PJ’s notorious charm owes to him. When the “Bunnamatic” coffeemaker was new, PJ’s had the freshest coffee in town. (Besides that, they sold too much of it for it to become stale!)</p>
              <p>In April 1997, PJ’s unfortunately was gutted by fire, and then we discovered a delightful new coffee shop “The Small World Café” with old world charm, and serving 4 or 5 varieties of coffee and espresso.</p>
              <p>Our favorite coffee spots in Barcelona were razed in 1995 to make space for a new hotel and convention center: Café Zurich Bar and Bracafe were were adjacent independent outdoor cafes, where everybody used to meet their friends. You could sit there for hours undisturbed by the waiters. Just as in France, your drink was the price you paid for the table where you sat. I’ve sat at the <em>Café des Deux Magots</em> in Paris for hours reading, e.g. Sartre’s <em>La Nausée</em>, or L’Être <em>et le Néant</em>, and <em>Camus’ La Plague</em>, or <em>L’Etranger</em>, which I purchased at Gallimard’s <em>Librairie</em> next door.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2807-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2807"><sup>65</sup></a> And since Sartre and Camus wrote at the café, the books may well have been written there.</p>
              <p>In <em>The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field</em>, (Princeton U. Press paperback) Jacques Hadamard relates how Henri Poincaré discovered “Theta Fuchsian Functions.” After a long period of fruitless conscientious endeavor, the idea for them hit like a bolt of lightning one day as he stepped onto a tram going to work. The unconscious did the work in a relaxed moment. <strong>Voilà: Cafés</strong>.</p>
              <p>In Café Mediteranean, Berkeley’s first coffee house, inspirational classical music is constantly piped into the cafe for the benefit of the patrons who are a mixture of professors, students, poets, artists, writers, and panhandlers (The latter line up on Telegraph Avenue asking for “spare change.”) It’s where I wrote much of Volume I of my <em>Algebra</em>. Later, I wrote much of Volume II and most of my part of <em>FPF Ring Theory</em> in PJ’s. (I duly acknowledged PJ’s in the latter book, published in 1984.)</p>
              <p>Now that Starbucks and Bucks County Coffee Houses dot the Eastern Coast, one can expect a cornucopia of mathematical works. However, I have yet to encounter Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat’s last theorem, in PJ’s, but one day Brooke (“Pretty Baby”) Shields and a friend of hers slipped onto stools next to mine and chatted oblivious of the crackling mathematical thunderbolts. (I have seen Professor Wiles in less restful places in Princeton, e.g. Urken’s Hardware.)</p>

              <p>Two other wonderful places in Princeton, the Colonial Diner, and the College Diner, also burned down, the latter allegedly by “Crazy Eddie,” an entrepreneur whose radio and TV sales pitch was “insane.” (He was a co-owner, who allegedly needed the insurance money and fled to Israel to escape being arrested.)</p>
              <p>The Colonial Diner was on Witherspoon Street which is named after a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a president of Princeton University (which it is perpendicular to). It was convenient to the Princeton Public Library where you would stock up on books to read at the diner. Two local people, “Captain” Bill, and Jay Wilson, used to engage in brilliant conversation in low tones for hours on end, and I could tune in or out at will.</p>
              <p>One conversation that I tuned in on was Captain Bill’s horology and how it destined him and Svetlana Alliluyeva to marry. Unfortunately for Bill, Svetlana was aloof to the idea, although it appears that they met several times socially. (Luckily for Svetlana, his horoscope was myopic.)</p>
              <p>Captain Bill might well have been called “Crazy” Bill, since he often stood at the intersection of Nassau and Witherspoon in front of the University shouting at the top of his lungs. I once asked him why, and he gave this wonderfully Zen response: <em>to get an echo</em>.</p>

              <p>I heard him lecture on the solution in the Sheraton Hotel in New York at a meeting of the American Mathematical Society, and nobody gave a better, funnier lecture in my then youthful experience.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2811-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2811"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
              <p>At PJ’s Stanley took up conversing with Jay where Captain Bill left off, and I continued tuning in and out, periodically tuning onto the omnipresent radio that the cook needed to keep himself in tempo with the (mostly short) orders.</p>
              <p>Occasionally I was waved into the conversations in order to render a judgment on some point of contention between them, or, more often, to share some fun they thought up. Jay, a Princeton grad, knew practically everybody, and had marvelous anecdotes to recount. (<em>That made him a raconteur</em>?)</p>
              <p>Stanley had the gift of total recall down to the last minutia and minisecond. Often he quizzed me on my opinion on a conversation he had with somebody ten or twenty years ago that still lived in his mind like yesterday. This I found not as interesting as when they were conversing and telling stories, and I was placed in a quandary of how to avoid being interrogated by Stanley at too great a length. I hate myself for this, but I had thoughts of my own that I liked to think about, even when I went to a coffee house!</p>
              <p>Not to worry, Stanley came in and out of PJ’s so often, that allowing him five minutes here and five minutes there, he was able to get my reaction to his latest query. I never knew why he wanted <span class="math--inline" data-ams-doc="math inline">it<svg class="mjx-overflow" aria-braillelabel="⠀⠄⠄⠄" aria-label="ellipsis" style="vertical-align: -0.017ex;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1.852ex" height="0.255ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -114 887 122" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g><g><use xlink:href="#MJX-STX-N-2026"/></g></g></g></svg><span hidden="hidden" data-ams-doc="math tex">$\ldots$</span>maybe</span> out of curiosity?</p>
              <p>Stan suffered a serious heart attack about ten years ago, and I sent him a getwell telegram with an insider quip about his being wanted in Princeton for the theft of “Antoine’s Necklace.” To my dismay, I learned that this pun upset him a great deal, and a son of his (not Jonathan, the mathematician) chastised me for sending it. I never saw him after he convalesced and went to live with his daughter Susan.</p>

              <p>Serge Lang who was also visiting Berkeley in the spring of ’65 met me in the Coffee Room at Coffee Hour and challenged me to prove it. I must confess my knees were shaking. I am not an extemporaneous <em>ad hoc</em> quick thinker like Serge! However, this time I was prepared (probably the first and last time ever). As I wrote the simple, elementary proof on the board, I was wondering if I hadn’t made a mistake somewhere since it appeared uncharacteristically lucid. But no, Serge caught on right away and took the chalk out of my hand and finished the proof himself.</p>

              <p>In Fall 1965, I decided to audit some art courses in Berkeley’s famed Art Department. As an elementary school student, I was often <em>the</em> designated class artist for whatever art projects were needed, e.g. Thankgsiving and Halloween scenes, or scenery for skits and plays. Furthermore, at Holmes Junior High School I won an art scholarship at the Baker Hunt Foundation as a prize for a winning poster in Thomas Oertel’s art class.</p>
              <p>At Berkeley, I audited a Life Studies class taught by Fred Bullock, and a sculpture class under Ibram Lassaw.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2822-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2822"><sup>71</sup></a> They each were taken aback that a mathematician would want to study art, but nevertheless encouraged me in every way they could. Once, Mr. Bullock picked up a drawing of mine, showed it to the class with the comment “Now that could only be the arm of a woman.” (We were restricted to limbs before we earned the right to examine other parts of the model, and I made sure that I would qualify.)</p>
              <p>Lassaw, who was born in Odessa, and reared in Cairo, was an integral part of the New York art scene. He developed sculptures by melting shiny metals with an acetylene torch and building up open forms based on the constellations, or magnified photos of microscopic objects that he got out of Scientific American.</p>
              <p>We became quite good friends, and he invited me to visit his studio in the art department preparatory to going out for lunch. What I saw when he opened the door of his studio was a beautiful redhead with alabaster skin posing for him. Soft music emanated from his record player. I’m afraid that for once I was speechless since this scene didn’t square with his choice of models for his signature sculptures, but at lunch he confided to his wide-eyed student, “The way I look at it, <em>someone</em> has to enjoy life” and he was showing me—and how! I learned from him that a great artist is a great teacher—he made me want to emulate his hedonism! (Alas, mathematics does not have the same perks.)</p>
              <p>I asked Lassaw about his career. He told me that he was 40 years old before he sold his first sculpture, and that it was purchased by David Rockefeller for the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA).⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2823-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2823"><sup>72</sup></a> He went on to be acquired by many major museums, e.g. the National Gallery of Art. He related to me his experience in working in precious metals, gold and silver, for a synagogue in North Carolina: “the materials themselves cost $500,000.” I could well believe it.</p>
              <p>Occasionally, other teachers would substitute for Bullock and Lassaw. One named King did giant metal cut-outs of humans in a comical vein which may be seen at the University Art Museum. I once saw several at a MOMA installation.</p>
              <p>Another great artist I met at Berkeley was Elmer Bischoff, who went from abstract paintings to figurative paintings to abstract expressionism. His paintings also hang in major museums, including MOMA. I absolutely adored his many figurative paintings. Some of his personal collection went up in flames in the devastating fire in Oakland in 1991. (The New York Times carried a story on this.) However, according to Susan Landauer, curator of the San Jose Museum of Art, fortunately most of his work was stored elsewhere.⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2824-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2824"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
              <p>Two other great Berkeley artists well represented in international museums and private collections were Hans Hofmann (1880–1966) and Richard Diebenkorn (1922–1993).</p>

              <p>An engineering student of elementary differential equations named Mary⁠<a epub:type="noteref" id="ltxid2826-reflink-0" role="doc-noteref" data-ams-ref="fn" href="#ltxid2826"><sup>74</sup></a> was able to answer every question ever asked of her on the exams and every homework problem too. So following a tradition of the University of Kentucky, that straight A-students may be exempted from the final, I exempted her but collected her notebook instead, since we are required to keep final exams for a year. I noticed that she had worked out every problem in the book—not only the even numbered but also the odd. When I asked her why, she blurted out in class, “Oh, Professor Faith, you know it is so much fun!”</p>
              <p>Another student, an Asian Indian, in a course in combinatorics showed little enthusiasm for the subject, but when I asked her which course she did like, she brightened and said “abstract algebra.” Since this is perhaps the most hated and difficult undergraduate course, I evinced surprise and pleasure, and asked her why. She said, “Oh, Professor Faith, the theorems are so dramatic!” I told her that was the most beautiful reason ever given by a student for the study of abstract algebra, and that it is one that I gave in the introduction to my <em>Algebra</em> (see <strong>Envoi</strong> below).</p>
              <p>Another student of Abstract Algebra, Cindy Garrison, developed music theory using the theory of Abelian groups of order 12. The octave is equivalent to the unison in terms of the number of half steps from the starting point mod 12. (This means that an octave from B will give you a B.) Pythagoras, who originated the mathematical theory of chords and harmonics, would have been as proud of her as I was.</p>
              <p>In 1996, Jennifer McKinney won an outstanding teacher award in a New Jersey public school, her first year of teaching. She had been one of the best students that I ever had in Foundations of Mathematics, which is another course with a high level of abstraction that stymies many students (too many).</p>
              <p>In my very last class in Foundations, in spring 1996, Lauren Altucher asked me if we were going to study infinite cardinal numbers. Well, we always aimed to reach this far in the text, but usually, as in the class with Jennifer, there was at most one student who could have coped at that level. But in Lauren’s class, there was also Gabe Adamek, who went on to grad school at U. of Mass. the following fall, but I said “yes,” <em>simply because she wanted it</em>. As a reward, I let her give the lecture-demonstration of the well-ordering theorem. Largely based on her wonderful grasp of the subject, she was chosen for the Budapest Semesters for 1997–1998 which had been organized for gifted students. (My son, Japheth, had attended in the spring of 1987.)</p>
              <p>These gems, and hundreds of others, make teaching a joyous experience. On the other hand, not all students perform at this level, as the following poem by Billy Reeves, a student of mine at Penn State in the summer of 1959, attests.</p>

              <p>But you also have bright students exemplified by Anthony (“Tony”) Hager, who was at the top of a Calculus class I taught in Summer 1958 right before the ICM in Edinburgh. He went on to become my first student ever to receive the Ph.D. degree. (His was under Nathan Fine who had moved from Penn to Penn State after I left.) As a curiousity, Anthony had taken his first course in Calculus at M.I.T. under John Nash, whose life was the basis of the book “A Beautiful Mind” by Sylvia Nasar that was made into a movie with the same title. It opened in Princeton’s Garden Theatre in December 2001 to enthusiastic reviews. I have known John since coming to Princeton in 1960, and his son John Jr., who received his Ph.D. at Rutgers.</p>
              <p>But as an example of Billy Reeves’ poem, let me cite a humorous experience in 1962 in my first semester of teaching at Rutgers. A student in freshman calculus (then taught in the basement classrooms in the cliff dormitories, e.g. Frelinghuysen, overlooking the Raritan) stood up in class and volubly complained about the “give ‘em the keys” philosophy of teaching that I mentioned earlier. “Professor Faith, I’ve always learned things by memorization and I’m too old to change now!” I innocently asked, “How old are you?” “Eighteen”, he replied, and the class roared with laughter, breaking the tension. He went on to do well enough to get a “C” grade. (This was eons before anyone heard of “grade inflation”!)</p>

              <p>I have been working on this book for six years now. I do not pretend that this is a comprehensive study, far less an encyclopedic one. Some of the specialized articles in the Kluwer <em>Handbook of Algebra</em> run to half this book’s size; and the <em>Cambridge Encyclopedia of Mathematics</em> is published in booksize bites! There are plenty of mathematicians including some of the “greats” who won’t show up here. As I intimated by the Russian proverb on the first page of the Preface, my tastes, background and research interests have guided me throughout. Yet even beyond this, I have been seduced by the drama and beauty of the theorems. I am not alone in this:</p>

                <p>“Beauty is the first test: there is no place in the world for ugly mathematics”—G.H. Hardy in “Mathematician’s Apology” (1940).</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Robert Graves wrote in a similar vein about poetry in his book <em>The White Goddess</em>. Rather than Graves, we shall quote a mathematician:</p>
              <blockquote data-ams-style="null">
                <p>“What motivates mathematicians is not the desire to solve practical problems or even problems of science. The important drives are aesthetic coming from the internal appeal of mathematics in itself”—Sir Roger Penrose in his review of <em>Fermat’s Enigma</em> by Simon Singh in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, November 30, 1997.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This echoes Einstein: “Science will stagnate if it is made to serve practical goals” (quoted in Calaprice’s “The Quotable Einstein”, p.181.)</p>
              <p>Sir Roger (<em>ibid</em>.) had other important things to say about mathematics:</p>
              <blockquote data-ams-style="null">
                <p>“What is unusual about mathematics is that it is possible to settle differences of opinion by definitive argument—majority opinion counts for naught; so does authority. The sound mathematical reasoning of a single individual suffices.”</p>

              <p>I beg the readers to remember this good advice before citing me (or this book) as an authority. (Ha!)</p>
